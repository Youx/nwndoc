        <h2>Welcome to NWNDoc</h2>
<p>
NWNDoc is a developper documentation to the NWNScript language, used in the
game Neverwinter Nights. It is based on <a href="http://www.nwnlexicon.com">NWNLexicon</a> but with better search options.
</p>

<h2>Getting Started</h2>
<p>
Just write part of a function name in the left bar and off you go!
</p>

<h2>Getting your own version</h2>
<p>If you're using this site from the web, you can download it locally from <a href="http://github.com/Youx/nwndoc/downloads/">here</a>. No php, database, web server or anything is required. Download, extract, launch index.html in your favourite browser.</p>

<h2>How it works</h2>

<h3>Sources</h3>
<p>NWNDoc uses <a href="http://www.nwnlexicon.com">NWNLexicon</a> as it sources.</p>
<p>You can check out all the source data and generation code from <a href="http://github.com/Youx/nwndoc">nwndoc's project page</a></p>

<h3>Format</h3>
<p>However, the HTML files were translated into a descriptive format
called YAML.</p>
<p>With YAML, we simply describe how a function help page is represented : 
	There is a "name:" field, a "shortdesc:" field, a "bugs:" field, a "parameters:", with each parameter having
	a type, a name, a description, a default value, ...</p>
<pre>
---
name: MyFunctionName
shortdesc: A short description of the function
parameters:
  - type: int
    name: parameter1
    desc: description of parameter 1
  - type: location
    name: parameter2
    desc: description of parameter 2
    default: DEFAULT_VALUE2
bugs: |
  Here we can write there is a known bug for this function
  and we can span it on multiple lines.
requires: |
  #include "functionrequiresthatfile"
example: |
  Here is an example
</pre>
<p>The good thing about this is that it's a strict descriptive representation, not a visual one (like html). We can then translate this YAML file into whatever form we want</p>

<h3>Transformations</h3>
<h4>YAML -> Textile</h4>
<p>Each YAML file goes through a template (we use ruby liquid templates), we formats it into a textile format</p>
<p>At the end of this process, we obtain a file in the Textile format, that would look like this : </p>
<pre>
h1. MyFunctionName

h4. A short description of the function

MyFunctionName(
  int parameter1, /* description of parameter 1 */
  location parameter2 = DEFAULT_VALUE2 /* description of parameter 2 */
);

h4. Requires

#include "functionrequiresthatfile"

h4. Example

Here is an example

h4. Known bugs

Here we can write there is a known bug for this function
and we can span it on multiple lines.
</pre>
<h4>Textile -> HTML</h4>
<p>The textile file is then processed by textile, h1. is replaced by stuff like \<h1\>\</h1\> and we have a html file</p>

<h3>Indexing</h3>
<p>So what is the purpose you ask? We had NWNLexicon HTML files, we translated them to YAML, so that we could process those into Textile and then back to HTML?</p>
<p>Well, the interesting thing is : YAML can be processed, so we can do more than YAML -> HTML. For example, let's index all the function names and put those into javascript, so that we can easily query the function name or the description of the function!</p>
<p>Or let's index all the Functions and Constants names to put links in the html that point to other functions!</p>

<h3>How to help?</h3>
<p>To modify a function, it's easy : you just modify (or add) the corresponding .yaml file, and just send the modifications.</p>
<p>If you are more technically inclined and know how to use a version system, fork the project on github and I'll just have to pull in the modifications you make.</p>

<h3>How to build</h3>
<p>If you are a developer and want to generate all the HTML files and javascript, you will need : </p>
<ul>
	<li>ruby</li>
	<li>liquid (a ruby gem)</li>
	<li>RedCloth (a ruby gem)</li>
	<li>json (a ruby gem)</li>
	<li>coderay (a ruby gem)</li>
	<li>A little time, generating everything takes about 20s on my computer.</li>
</ul>

<h3>What needs to be done</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Add some stuff, like VFX images, data types, more examples for 1.69 functions, ...</li>
	<li>Add automatic linking to functions/constants in the pages</li>
</ul>

<h3>I used stuff from : </h3>
<ul>
	<li>The <a href="http://github.com/voloko/sdoc">sdoc</a> project, that created the search function</li>
	<li>The <a href="http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll">jekyll</a> project for the syntax highlighting bindings and the concept to generate static html from YAML/Textile</li>
</ul>
