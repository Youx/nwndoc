  A very simple function which merely takes the passed in parameters and calls the TakeGoldFromCreature() function using those same parameters. It is also defined exactly the same in two different include files. This is also the unfortunate reason why you can't include those two files in the same script. 
  This function will fail if called from an area or module event (like an area's OnEnter). However, it works on triggers, so you can just paint a trigger around the arrival area to get the same effect.
