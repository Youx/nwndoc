    name: oTarget
    desc: | Target for the spell

  - type: int

    desc: | METAMAGIC_* (Default: METAMAGIC_ANY)

  - type: int
    name: bCheat

bugs: |
  nProjectilePathType
  PROJECTILE_PATH_TYPE_* (Default: PROJECTILE_PATH_TYPE_DEFAULT)
  bInstantSpell
  If this is TRUE, the spell is cast immediately. This allows the end-user to simulate a high-level magic-user having lots of advance warning of impending trouble (Default: FALSE)
description: |
  Casts nSpell at oTarget with regards to the values of the other parameters. At minimum nSpell and oTarget must be specified for this function to work. 
remarks: |
  Object oTarget should be a valid target such as a creature or PC. Experiment with different target types as some targets do not work with this function (verified that this function does not work with barrels).
bugs: |
  The variable nDomainLevel should define the caster level of the spell, but this variable is ignored. 
  When a henchman casts any one of the following three spells listed below on itself, the henchman loses all spell casting ability. 
  SPELL_EAGLE_SPLENDOR 
  SPELL_FOXS_CUNNING 
  SPELL_OWLS_WISDOM 
  1.64 does fix the problem with sub-dial spells. These can now be cast correctly using these functions. It doesn't mention any fixes for the above issues however.
  1.68 does fix the problem with Ranger and Paladin spells not working properly. (nMetaMagic was ignored in the spell script)
version: 1.68
example: |
  // The script below is placed on the OnUse Event handler for a placeable, in our
  // example a lever. When used it casts a Magic Missile spell at the target. In this case
  // the target is a nearby commoner called "TARGET2". Try this script for kicks.
  void main()
  {
      object oTarget = GetObjectByTag("TARGET2");
      ActionCastSpellAtObject(SPELL_MAGIC_MISSILE,oTarget,1);
  }
