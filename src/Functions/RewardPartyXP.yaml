type: Function
name: RewardPartyXP
shortdesc: Gives experience to a PC and (optionally) all party members.
return: void
parameters:
  - type: int
    name: nXP
    desc: | Amount of XP to award.

  - type: object
    name: oTarget
    desc: | Object to award XP.

  - type: int
    name: bAllParty
    default: TRUE
    desc: | If TRUE, award XP to all party members. (Default: TRUE)

description: |
  If bAllParty is FALSE, this is equivalent to GiveXPToCreature(XP, oTarget); 
  If bAllParty is TRUE, this function cycles through oTarget's faction (party) and awards XP to each party member.
remarks: |
  XP is awarded equally to each party member, not divided between them. 
  You cannot use a negative number for nXP. Instead, use SetXP for all party members.
requirements: |
  #include "nw_i0_tool"
version: 1.61
example: |
  #include "nw_i0_generic"
  #include "nw_i0_tool"
  // Area OnEnter script
  // (perhaps if entry is only gained by some difficult 
  // encounter or serious cunning).
  //
  // Rewards the PC and every party member with the XP
  // set in the Journal editor.
  void main() 
  {
       object oPC = GetEnteringObject();
       if (! GetIsPC(oPC)) return;
       RewardPartyXP(GetJournalQuestExperience("hard_to_reach"), oPC, TRUE);
