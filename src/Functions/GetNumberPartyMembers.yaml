shortdesc: Returns the number of players in the PC's party +1
return: int
parameters:
  - type: object
    name: oPC
    desc: | Player Character

description: |
  Returns the number of Player Characters in the PC's party, including the PC, +1 due to an out-by-one coding error. 
  Does NOT include associates. 
  Uses GetFirst/NextFactionMember while valid, returns count.
remarks: |
  Include library for party-wide functions. 
  NOTE: this library is included in "x0_i0_common" already. 
  Do NOT dual-include both files or you will get errors!
bugs: |
  Code initializes with 1 before starting count, presumably to include the oPC, then counts the oPC again during its use of GetFirst/NextFactionMember. Reducing the count by 1 should return the correct number.- 1/28/04, NWN Toolset version vts026, game version 1.61.8042 English
requirements: |
  #include "X0_I0_PARTYWIDE"
version: 1.61

  // returns correct number of PCs in oPC's party
