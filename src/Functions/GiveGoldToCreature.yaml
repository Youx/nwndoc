shortdesc: Creates the specified amount of gold on the creature.
return: void
parameters:
  - type: object
    name: oCreature
    desc: | Creature set to receive the windfall.

  - type: int

description: |
  Give nGP gold to oCreature. 
  nGP must be positive - to remove gold use TakeGoldFromCreature().
remarks: |
  This mearly creates new gold, it does in no sense pass over gold from the calling object - the name is deceptive!
version: 1.61
example: |
  // Put OnClientEnter of the module's properties
  // to have all PCs start out with exactly 500 gold pieces
  void main()
  {
      object oPC=GetEnteringObject();
      // Make sure it only happens on the first entry of the player
      // * Note: If the module resets (multiplayer), they'll yet 
      //    again get a minimum of 500 gold because 
      //    SetLocalInt isn't persistant over resets.
      if (GetLocalInt(oPC, "gold_reset")) return;
      // Set so they can't get the gold again. This won't be persistant
      // over module resets.
      SetLocalInt(oPC, "gold_reset", TRUE);
      // How much gold does the PC already have?
      int nGold=GetGold(oPC);
      //Too much, too little, or just enough?
      if (nGold>500)
      {
          //Too much!
          // * See the TakeGoldFromCreature() comments to see why
          //    it requires AssignCommand().
          AssignCommand(oPC, TakeGoldFromCreature(nGold-500, oPC, TRUE));
      }
      else if (nGold<500)
      {
          //Too little!
          GiveGoldToCreature(oPC, 500-nGold);
      }
  }
