type: Function
name: GetFactionLeader
shortdesc: Gets the leader of a players party.
return: object
parameters:
  - type: object
    name: oMemberOfFaction
    desc: | Player object that is in the party of the leader you are seeking.

description: |
  Returns the leader (in an object variable) of the faction (party) of which oMemberOfFaction is a member. 
  Return value is OBJECT_INVALID if oMemberOfFaction is not a valid creature, or is a NPC faction.
remarks: |
  Used to get the leader of a player run party. Usually, the "leader" is hardly ever used, and is mearly the person who has control of who to kick from a party more then anything else. 
  Cannot be used for NPC factions as there is no way to define a leader for them. 
  This cannot be reproduced using anything else, and is one of the few totally unique GetFactionXXX() function calls.
version: 1.62
example: |
  // Placed in the Modules OnPlayerDeath Event, this will send a 
  // message to the player's party leader, informing them that
  // this player has died.
  void main()
  {
      // Get the last player who died
      object oPC = GetLastPlayerDied();
      // Get thier "leader", the one with a little crown
      object oLeader = GetFactionLeader(oPC);
      // Get the name of the player who died
      string sName = GetName(oPC);
      // Now, if the leader is valid and NOT the person who died (um, 
      // duh, who'd want a message about thier own death?) then 
      // send the message.
      if(GetIsObjectValid(oLeader) == TRUE &&
         oLeader != oPC)
      {
          SendMessageToPC(oLeader, sName + " has died!");
      }
  }
