description: |
  Sets the amount of gold a store has. -1 means the store does not use gold.
remarks: |
  Stores don't use gold by default. A store that uses gold will only buy items that it can afford. Stores that don't will buy items of any price, unless you specify a max price with the SetStoreMaxBuyPrice command.
  Whenever a store makes a transaction with a player, the gold gained or spent is automatically reflected in the store's gold supply.
  Having a store identify an item will also add the gold you pay for the identification to the store's gold.
