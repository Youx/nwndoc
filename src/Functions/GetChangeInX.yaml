type: Function
name: GetChangeInX
shortdesc: Convinence function to calculate the change in the X axis
return: float
parameters:
  - type: float
    name: fDistance
    desc: | Distance to target location

  - type: float
    name: fAngle
    desc: | Direction to target Location

description: |
  This is a convenience function that returns the product of fDistance*Cos(fAngle) as a float. This number would than be used to calculate the amount to needed to change the X-axis of the current location in order to reach the target location. This function would normally be used with float GetChangeInY(float fDistance, float fAngle) 
  Calls 
  Float Cos(float fAngle)
