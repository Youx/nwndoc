type: Function
name: GetModuleItemLostBy
shortdesc: Get the creature that lost the item on an OnUnAcquiredItem event.
return: object
parameters:
description: |
  Returns the object that dropped an item triggering the OnUnAcquiredItem event. On error this function will return OBJECT_INVALID; this should not be possible as the event is triggered by an item drop, but if you trigger the event manually then be aware of this error.
remarks: |
  We know that the OnUnacquireItem fires for objects destroyed by 
  DestroyObject, right? Well, the object returned by this function is not 
  OBJECT_INVALID in this case, but it is also not an existing object so any 
  usage of it does not function correctly. Instead of checking for 
  OBJECT_INVALID, the users of this function should always use 
  GetIsObjectValid, which returns FALSE for the case mentioned above. 
version: 1.28
example: |
  // This will find the name of the creature the item was dropped by.
  void main()
  {
      object a = GetModuleItemLost();
      if(a == OBJECT_INVALID)
          SendMessageToPC(GetFirstPC(),"OOPS A CRASH ME THINKS");
      else {
          SendMessageToPC(GetFirstPC(),GetTag(a));
          a = GetModuleItemLostBy();
          if(a == OBJECT_INVALID)
              SendMessageToPC(GetFirstPC(),"OOPS A CRASH ME THINKS");
          else
              SendMessageToPC(GetFirstPC(),"And was dropped by " + GetTag(a));
          }
  }
