type: Function
name: SetItemCursedFlag
shortdesc: Sets whether an item is cursed or not
return: void
parameters:
  - type: object
    name: oItem
    desc: | Item to set cursed flag on

  - type: int
    name: nCursed
    desc: | TRUE or FALSE

description: |
  When cursed, items cannot be dropped. 
  This is the same as the flag as can be set in an items properties.
remarks: |
  This doesn't stop an item being removed from thier inventory slots, but it cannot be dropped on the floor. 
  Items which are cursed and which are in a placeable cannot be "dropped" by the placeable, so cannot be removed. 
  Inventory containers (IE: Bags of Holding and Boxes) act like new containers for the purposes of where items can be moved to or taken from. 
  Note: It can still be sold! Setting the plot flag on the item is a good idea. 1.63 is meant to fix this.
version: 1.62
example: |
  // When aquired, an item with the variable "CURSED" is set
  // to TRUE on it, it will curse and plot the item.
  void main()
  {
      // Check what item was aquired
      object oItem = GetModuleItemAcquired();
      // Check the variable
      if(GetLocalInt(oItem, "CURSED") == TRUE)
      {
          // Set so it cannot be sold or removed from the inventory
          SetItemCursedFlag(oItem, TRUE);
          SetPlotFlag(oItem, TRUE);
      }
  }
