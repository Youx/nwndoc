type: Function
name: ItemPropertySpecialWalk
shortdesc: Sets a special walk itemproperty.
return: itemproperty
parameters:
  - type: int
    name: nWalkType
    default: 0
    desc: | Walktype. (Default: 0)

description: |
  Sets item property Special walk. If no parameters are specified it will automatically use the zombie walk. This will apply the special walk animation to the user.
remarks: |
  This appears to be applicable only to creature hides. Also, it seems the only valid walktype is the default 0 (zombie walk). Could be fun perhaps to use in a spell to make your opponent start walking like a zombie... 
  The itemproperty commands are special constructors - they construct an itemproperty "object" which can then be applied to an item using the AddItemProperty command, much like effects need to be first constructed, then applied with ApplyEffectToObject. 
  It will often be a good idea to remove similar itemproperties from the item first. There's a command in the "x2_inc_itemprop" include file called IPSafeAddItemProperty which will do that for you. Check IPSafeAddItemProperty for current bug report.
