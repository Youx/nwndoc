description: |
  Create a Skill Talent. 
  This should not be used - it doesn't currently work.
remarks: |
  The SKILL_* constants reflect rownumbers in skills.2da 
  It should do the same as ActionUseSkill(), but currently is broken and using it doesn't work in anyway whatsoever. Definatly use ActionUseSkill() until it is fixed or removed.
bugs: |
  Currently, anytime this is used, it is invalid and if passed into ActionUseTalent, it will result in the NPC not doing anything and standing there.
version: 1.30
example: |
  // Code sample is invalid as it won't work. TalentSpell/Feat/Skill doesn't work.
