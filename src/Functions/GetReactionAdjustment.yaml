description: |
  Returns the adjusted Reaction for the purposes of store pricing. A default faction adjustment is set at 2.0 (which is probably 200% markup rate), but if the target is a friendly to the caller, this is set to 1.0. 
  It then compares the Law/Chaos levels between the caller and the target and gets the numeric difference between them. It does the same for the Good/Evil scale as well and adds both differences together. 
  The script then applies the following formulae to figure out the final reaction adjustment: 
  10 + The differences between alignments - the target's Charisma modifier times 10 and times it all by the Faction Adjustment.
