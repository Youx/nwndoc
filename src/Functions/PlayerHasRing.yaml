  Found in nw_j_rescue.nss on line 202 
  Though by looking at it, you would assume it uses oPC as the object to check for the ring, it actually doesn’t use oPC for anything – instead, it checks for the ring on the PC speaker, meaning that this function can only be used in conversations, otherwise it will always return FALSE. Small loss, as it is of little value for general scripting purposes, seeing as it is part of Bioware’s system for giving quests and rewards. It might be good to learn from, though.
