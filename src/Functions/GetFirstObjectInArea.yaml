type: Function
name: GetFirstObjectInArea
shortdesc: Determines the first object in an area.
return: object
parameters:
  - type: object
    name: oArea
    default: OBJECT_INVALID
    desc: | The area that contains the objects. (Default: OBJECT_INVALID)

description: |
  Returns the first object in oArea and OBJECT_INVALID if no objects exists or on any error. 
  If no valid area is specified, it will use the caller's area.
remarks: |
  Useful for making sure all things of a cirtain tag, or type, in an area are destroyed and may be easier then using GetObjectByTag(). 
  Do not do it too often in larger, or more populated areas. 
  There is no way to loop areas in a module, which is a shame (unless a system is devised). Therefore, it is hard to loop all objects in a module (although this is almost never ever ever required).
bugs: |
  Creatures possessed by a DM are skipped. 
  The remark before about encounters not being picked up by this seem to have changed in the Hordes patches. They are now picked up.
version: 1.62
example: |
  // Any objects in the area tagged "DESTROY" are destroyed.
  // Uses OBJECT_SELF as the area, but this can be subsituted for
  // many things.
  void main()
  {
      // Loop all objects in us, an area
      object oArea = OBJECT_SELF;
      object oObject = GetFirstObjectInArea(oArea);
      while(GetIsObjectValid(oObject))
      {
           // Destroy any objects tagged "DESTROY"
           if(GetTag(oObject) == "DESTROY")
           {
               DestroyObject(oObject);
           }
           oObject = GetNextObjectInArea(oArea);
      }
  }
