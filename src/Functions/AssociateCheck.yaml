description: |

  As the code below shows, AssociateCheck wraps GetAssociate() with an object comparison. GetAssociate may be clearer to use in your scripts.
requirements: |
  #include "nw_i0_generic"
version: 1.22
example: |
  // This is the AssociateCheck code from nw_i0_generic
  int AssociateCheck(object oCheck)
  {
      object oHench = GetAssociate (ASSOCIATE_TYPE_HENCHMAN);
      if(oCheck != oHench)
      {
          return TRUE;
      }
      return FALSE;
  }
