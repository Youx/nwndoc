type: Function
name: LineOfSightVector
shortdesc: Returns whether there's a direct line between two positions
return: int
parameters:
  - type: vector
    name: vSource
    desc: | Source position

  - type: vector
    name: vTarget
    desc: | Target position

description: |
  Returns whether or not there is a direct line of sight between the two vectors. (Not blocked by any geometry). 
  This function must be run on a valid object in the area it will not work on the module or area. 
  PLEASE NOTE: This is an expensive function and may degrade performance if used frequently.
remarks: |
  Vectors are location markers - being a set of 3 co-ordinates (X, Y, Z), and so this can be used instead of LineOfSightObject() if the 2 objects just had thier vector got by GetPosition().
