remarks: |
  This is another one of those counter intuitive functions. While you are affecting a specific tile that tile is being identified by a location. Also the location used to locate a tile is different than the location used to locate an object, a tile is located by the integer portion of a location in that tile / 10. Or for me I just remember that tiles are numbered in a zero based integer matrix, so the lower left tile in a 3X3 area would be located with a Location-object that has a member vector whose x and y = 0.
