type: Function
name: IPGetDamagePowerConstantFromNumber
shortdesc: Converts a number to a damage power constant
return: int
parameters:
  - type: int
    name: nNumber
    desc: | Damage power.

description: |
  Mapping between numbers and power constants for ITEM_PROPERTY_DAMAGE_BONUS returns the appropriate ITEM_PROPERTY_DAMAGE_POWER_* constant for nNumber.
remarks: |
  This function is only useful for effects, since effects are the only functions using DAMAGE_POWER_*. 
  Used by the arcane archer scripts in x0_i0_spells / x0_s2_hailarrows.
bugs: |
  It claims to return ITEM_PROPERTY_DAMAGE_POWER_* but this doesn't exist. It returns DAMAGE_POWER_* instead.
requirements: |
  #include "x2_inc_itemprop"
version: 1.61
