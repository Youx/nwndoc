type: Function
name: ActionJumpToObject
shortdesc: Teleports the calling object to the nearest valid location by the target.
return: void
parameters:
  - type: object
    name: oTarget
    desc: | Target object that will be jumped to

  - type: int
    name: bWalkStraightLineToPoint
    default: TRUE
    desc: | Unknown (Default: TRUE)

description: |
  The calling object will be relocated to the position of oTarget (or as near as possible). This function will work within or across area borders. 
  If oTarget isn't a valid object (or is unspecified) the function call will fail.
remarks: |
  There is no visual effect associated with this action. If you wish one such, you must create it yourself. Using ApplyEffectAtLocation() and ApplyEffectAtObject() combined with an EffectVisualEffect() effect is great for doing this. 
  Unless you specifically intend to add the jump command into a queue with other actions, it is usually more practical to use 'JumpToObject', which has an immediate effect. 
  Like all spawn and jump-type commands, this will place the calling object in the nearest valid location to the oTarget. 
  When a PC leaves an Area or Trigger because you've jumped to a location causes the OnExit event of the departed object to fire. 
  Does not affect creatures that are dead; they must have HP above 0 for this function to work properly. 
  Speculation: The bWalkStraightLineToPoint parameter should make the caller of the function walk to the target if very close to it. This does not happen, and in fact, changing it to FALSE doesn't seem to have any effect. If anyone figures out what this parameter is for, please use the link at the bottom of the page to send the Lexicon's authors a comment on this function.

example: |
  // Emulates a teleport spell with lingering visual effects
  void main()
  {
       // spell target
       location locSpellTarget = GetLocation(OBJECT_SELF);
       // teleport target
       object oJumpTarget = GetObjectByTag("WP_jumpTarget");
       ApplyEffectAtLocation(DURATION_TYPE_INSTANT, EffectVisualEffect(VFX_IMP_UNSUMMON), locSpellTarget);
       ActionWait(2.0);
       ActionJumpToObject(oJumpTarget);
  }
