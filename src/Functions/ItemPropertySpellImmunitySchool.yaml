type: Function
name: ItemPropertySpellImmunitySchool
shortdesc: Sets an "immunity against spell school" itemproperty.
return: itemproperty
parameters:
  - type: int
    name: nSchool
    desc: | IP_CONST_SPELLSCHOOL_*

description: |
  Sets item property Spell immunity vs. spell school. You must specify the school to which the user will be immune (IP_CONST_SPELLSCHOOL_*).
remarks: |
  The itemproperty commands are special constructors - they construct an itemproperty "object" which can then be applied to an item using the AddItemProperty command, much like effects need to be first constructed, then applied with ApplyEffectToObject. 
  It will often be a good idea to remove similar itemproperties from the item first. There's a command in the "x2_inc_itemprop" include file called IPSafeAddItemProperty which will do that for you. Check IPSafeAddItemProperty for current bug report. 
  The IP_CONST_SPELLSCHOOL_* value can be retrieved off this type of item property using GetItemPropertySubType.
version: 1.61
example: |
  #include "x2_inc_itemprop"
  //The include is for the IPSafeAddItemProperty function
  //Makes the PC speaker's helmet grant immunity to illusion school spells
  void main()
  {
  object oPC = GetPCSpeaker();
  object oItem = GetItemInSlot(INVENTORY_SLOT_HEAD, oPC);
  if (!GetIsObjectValid(oItem)) return;
  itemproperty ipAdd = ItemPropertySpellImmunitySchool(IP_CONST_SPELLSCHOOL_ILLUSION);
  IPSafeAddItemProperty(oItem, ipAdd);
  }
