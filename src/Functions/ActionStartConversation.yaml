name: ActionStartConversation
shortdesc: NPC action to start a conversation with a PC
return: void
parameters:
  - type: object
    name: oObjectToConverseWith
    desc: | An object to converse with.

  - type: string
    name: sDialogResRef
    default: ""
    desc: | The resource reference (filename) of a conversation. (Default: "")

  - type: int
    name: bPrivateConversation
    default: FALSE
    desc: | Specify whether the conversation is audible to everyone or only to the PC. (Default: FALSE)

  - type: int
    name: bPlayHello
    default: TRUE
    desc: | Determines if initial greeting is played. (Default: TRUE)

description: |
  Using this function in a script adds ActionStartConversation to the executing object's Action Queue. 
  When an object executes ActionStartConversation, it attempts to use the dialogue file specified as sDialogResRef to start conversing with the target, oObjectToConverseWith. If the target is not a PC, the target's OnConversation event fires. 
  sResRef is the filename resource reference of a conversation file. If no sResRef is specified, then default conversation of whichever object is not the PC is used (set in its properties in the Toolset). 
  If bPrivateConversation is TRUE, then the conversation remains between the PC and the other object, nothing else can see the text appearing. Otherwise, if FALSE (by default) the conversation is broadcast as chat, and 'audible' to other players. 
  bPlayHello, if FALSE, should stop the voicechat, VOICE_CHAT_HELLO, being played by the NPC (or whatever it may be that has a sound set) when a conversation is started. Obviously, this only applies to creatures with soundsets anyway.
remarks: |
  PCs can have dialogue with NPCs, placeables, triggers and doors. Items cannot converse (but invisible placeables with the same name as an item can). 
  Any immobile object in a conversation must be within the PC's camera view (approximately 10 meters when the camera is auto-zoomed in). If you try to start a conversation between a door and a PC, and the door is more than 10 meters away, the conversation box will appear briefly and then close immediately, although the door's first line will appear in the PC's chat window. If the object executing the action is mobile, it will attempt to run to oObjectToConverseWith and begin conversation, but will give up if another action is added to its queue 
  Unreliable results can occur from using AssignCommand() to add ActionStartConversation() to a PC's action queue, since players' normal movement commands are very likely to cancel the action. 
  sResRef is the filename of the conversation file, which is the string that appears in the Module Contents' "Conversations" chooser. 
  PCs do not have the OnConversation event, and do not have a default conversation file. 
  It is not possible at present to control camera zoom, although angle and mode can be scripted. 
  You can make a PC talk with "itself" by telling the PC to talk to itself, IE: AssignCommand(oPC, ActionStartConversation(oPC, "converse", TRUE)); . It is always a good idea for bPrivateConversation to be TRUE in these cases as usually it seems odd when a PC talks to themselves!
bugs: |
  Prior to patch 1.28, ActionStartConversation caused a crash when it was assigned to an area or module. 
  The note about bPrivateConversation was misleading, and it IS now bPrivateConversation, and the comment been removed from the remarks.
version: 1.62
