type: Function
name: GetItemPossessedByParty
shortdesc: Check to see if the specified item belongs to anyone in the party.
return: object
parameters:
  - type: object
    name: oPC
    desc: | The character whose party is to be checked.

  - type: string
    name: sItemTag
    desc: | The item to be looked for.

description: |
  Returns the item object if it is found, otherwise returns OBJECT_INVALID. 
  Checks each PC in oPC's party to see if they have an item with a tag of sItemTag. 
  Only checks PC's, not associates.
remarks: |
  This is essentially a wrapper for the GetItemPossessedBy function. 
  The specified PC (oPC) is checked first, then the rest of the party. If there are multiple copies of the item in the party, only the first will be returned. 
  Also note that x0_i0_partywide is already included in x0_i0_common. So you will only need to include one, not both.
requirements: |
  #include "x0_i0_partywide"
