type: Function
name: GetFactionAverageGoodEvilAlignment
shortdesc: Get the average number (between 0 and 100 inclusive) of the all objects within the object's faction that represents the Good/Evil alignment
return: int
parameters:
  - type: object
    name: oFactionMember
    desc: | The creature or object whose faction average you wish to examine.

description: |
  Returns an integer between 0 and 100 (inclusive) that represents the average good/evil alignment of oFactionMember's faction. 
  Return value on error: -1 
  It is unknown if NPC's in a PC's faction affects this function call and the returned result, such sa summoned monsters, henchmen and familiars, or if those creatures can be used as the oFactionMember at all.
remarks: |
  This will search the module for all members of the object's faction and average out their Good/Evil alignment on a scale of 0 (Good) to 100 (Evil). 
  This will work exactly the same was as using GetFirst/NextFactionMemeber() and using GetGoodEvilValue(), only is much easier to code and probably better on performance. 
  Try to never use this on an NPC faction, only a PC's party faction, because NPC factions usually have dozens of NPC's, and thus may cause a lot of high CPU usage with faction calls such as this.
version: 1.62
example: |
  // Check the faction alignment of the PC's party, using a trigger.
  // It will make some NPC's go hostile if they are considered to be
  // evil on average.
  // Of course, it is kinda OOC knowledge. This function is more likely 
  // to be used in other ways.
  void main()
  {
      // Get the entering object
      object oPC = GetEnteringObject();
      string sLocal = "DO_ONCE" + ObjectToString(OBJECT_SELF);
      // Only do this once, only affects PC's
      if(GetLocalInt(oPC, sLocal) || !GetIsPC(oPC)) return;
      // Set to not do it again
      SetLocgalInt(oPC, sLocal, TRUE);
      // Check alignment - must be very evil!
      if(GetFactionAverageGoodEvilAlignment(oPC) <= 10)
      {
          // Get the town guard onto them
          object oGuard = GetNearestObjectByTag("TOWN_GUARD");
          // Attack!
          AdjustReputation(oPC, oGuard, -100);
          // Do an attack
          AssignCommand(oGuard, ActionAttack(oPC));
      }
