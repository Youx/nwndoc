type: Function
name: ForceRest
shortdesc: Fully restores a creature
return: void
parameters:
  - type: object
    name: oCreature
    desc: | Creature to rest

description: |
  Gives this creature the benefits of a rest (restored hitpoints, spells, feats, etc..) 
  It can be called if oCreature is in combat (Unlike ActionRest which will automatically fail) and so unless it is a wanted behaviour, mind to make sure oCreature is not in combat first.
remarks: |
  The effects of this function occur instantly. The creature doesn't actually go into resting mode. Use ActionRest if that is what you want. 
  Useful for repelinishing a PC's abilties and things for custom resting systems, dreams, or cutscenes (in which they rest). For NPC's, it is a good way to make sure they will replenish all thier feats and spells after a battle. 
  Only objects (creatures) who can rest can gain the benifits of this. Calling this on a placable or door (another object with hitpoints), will, sadly, fail.
version: 1.64
example: |
  void main()
  {
      // Get Entering Object
      object oEnterer = GetEnteringObject();
      // Make sure it is a PC
      if(GetIsPC(oEnterer))
      {
          // Rest them
          ForceRest(oEnterer);
          // Floaty text - a wizard did it.
          FloatingTextStringOnCreature("A wizard decided to replenish your health and spells", oEnterer, FALSE);
      }
  }
