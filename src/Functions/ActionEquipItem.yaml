type: Function
name: ActionEquipItem
shortdesc: Puts an item in possesion into an inventory slot.
return: void
parameters:
  - type: object
    name: oItem
    desc: | An item already in inventory

  - type: int
    name: nInventorySlot
    desc: | INVENTORY_SLOT_* constant to insert oItem into

description: |
  Puts oItem into nInventorySlot (INVENTORY_SLOT_*) of the calling creature. The item must already be in the inventory of the target. If there is already an item in nInventorySlot, it will be swapped out for oItem, and placed back in the inventory. 
  RETURNS: nothing, but if an error occurs the log file will contain "ActionEquipItem failed."
remarks: |
  It is unnecessary to issue an ActionUnequipItem() call before equipping oItem.
bugs: |
  Causes the game to crash when an invalid combination is specified. For example, if a creature has a short sword equiped in the on hand and a dagger equiped in the off hand, attempting to swap out the short sword for a dart causes a crash. 
  If you use this command to equip clothing on a creature that has just been created in a location visible to a player then the game can crash. This does not happen all the time, but be aware that it can.
version: 1.61
example: |
  //Function made by Lilac Soul to illustrate the use of
  //ActionEquipItem. This function creates an armor with the
  //resref "magic_armor" on an entering PC and makes him
  //or her equip it.
  void main()
  {
  object oPC=GetEnteringObject();
  //Not if the object isn't a PC
  if (!GetIsPC(oPC)) return;
  //Give the armor to the PC - I could first have checked
  //to see if the PC already had one...
  object oArmor=CreateItemOnObject("magic_armor", oPC);
  //Put on the armor
  DelayCommand(0.5, AssignCommand(oPC, ActionEquipItem(oArmor, INVENTORY_SLOT_CHEST)));
  DelayCommand(0.7, AssignCommand(oPC, ActionSpeakString("Ah, a new armor. I'd better put it on.")));
  }
