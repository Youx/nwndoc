type: Function
name: ItemPropertyExtraRangeDamageType
shortdesc: Sets an "extra ranged damagetype" itemproperty.
return: itemproperty
parameters:
  - type: int
    name: nDamageType
    desc: | IP_CONST_DAMAGETYPE_*

description: |
  Sets item property Extra ranged damage type. You must specify the extra ranged base damage type constant (IP_CONST_DAMAGETYPE_*), one of Piercing, Slashing or Bludgeoning, that you want applied. 
  NOTE: It is applicable only to ranged weapons.
remarks: |
  The itemproperty commands are special constructors - they construct an itemproperty "object" which can then be applied to an item using the AddItemProperty command, much like effects need to be first constructed, then applied with ApplyEffectToObject. 
  It will often be a good idea to remove similar itemproperties from the item first. There's a command in the "x2_inc_itemprop" include file called IPSafeAddItemProperty which will do that for you. Check IPSafeAddItemProperty for current bug report. 
  The IP_CONST_DAMAGETYPE_* value can be retrieved off this type of item property using GetItemPropertySubType.
version: 1.61
example: |
  #include "x2_inc_itemprop"
  //The include is for the IPSafeAddItemProperty function
  //Makes the PC speaker's onhand ranged weapon also deal buffeting damage
  void main()
  {
  object oPC=GetPCSpeaker();
  object oItem = GetItemInSlot(INVENTORY_SLOT_RIGHTHAND, oPC);
  if (!GetIsObjectValid(oItem)) return;
  itemproperty ipAdd = ItemPropertyExtraRangeDamageType(IP_CONST_DAMAGETYPE_BLUDGEONING);
  IPSafeAddItemProperty(oItem, ipAdd);
  }
