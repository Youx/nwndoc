    name: oTarget
    default: OBJECT_SELF

description: |
  Returns TRUE if oTarget's action stack can be modified.
remarks: |
  GetCommadable is used to test if an object's action queue is commandable, or in others words, can they or others (via AssignCommand) add/modify their action que. They can become uncommandable via the SetCommandable(FALSE,oTarget) function. This is useful when you want a PC to not be able to choose their actions for a short amount of time, or if you want an NPC to do something important, but who has scripting that would normally have the action called to fail (like a move to in a battle).
