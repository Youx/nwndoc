return: object
parameters:
description: |
  Use this in a trigger's OnClick event script to get the object that last clicked on it. This is identical to GetEnteringObject.
remarks: |
  The reason for it being identical to GetEnteringObject() is that triggers, or course, can be said to be clicked on, or entered, when a transition is used. 
  This function is of course not meant to be used outside cirtain events, as it can return long dead or invalid creatures.
version: 1.62
example: |
  // cause a PC that attempts to open a locked door to utter
  // some nonsense about requiring a key in a door's OnFailToOpen
  // event
  void main()
  {
      object oPC = GetClickingObject();
      if (GetIsObjectValid(oPC))
          AssignCommand(oPC, SpeakString("I need to find the key..."));
      else
          SpeakString("NO VALID TEMP PC");
  }
