type: Function
name: ActionMoveToObject
shortdesc: Cause action subject to move to a certain distance of a target object.
return: void
parameters:
  - type: object
    name: oTarget
    desc: | Object to move action subject to.

  - type: int
    name: bRun
    default: FALSE
    desc: | If this is TRUE, the action subject will run rather than walk. (Default: FALSE)

  - type: float
    name: fRange
    default: 1.0f
    desc: | The desired distance between the action subject and oTarget. (Default: 1.0f)

description: |
  The action subject will move to within fRange of oTarget. If there is no path to oTarget, the function will do nothing. The function call waits for the subject to reach oTarget before executing further actions in the action queue. 
  If an error occurs the log file will contain "ActionMoveToObject failed."
remarks: |
  Move to object functions (ActionForceMoveToObject, ActionMoveToObject) actually do path finding, unlike their move to location (ActionForceMoveToLocation, ActionMoveToLocation) counterparts.
bugs: |
  PCs ignore the value of bRun and always run to the target object. If you want a PC to walk rather than run, you must use ActionMoveToLocation instead.
