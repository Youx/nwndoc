description: |
  This is a plot specific function used to generate potions for Colmarr's Machine.
remarks: |
  Found in: nw_i0_2q4luskan.nss: 36 
  Reads a local variable off the Collmarr engine in the official campaign, and uses this to determine which potion to create. Not useful in everyday scripting, though it may serve as a good way to learn how to create different items depending on eg the state of some levers.
