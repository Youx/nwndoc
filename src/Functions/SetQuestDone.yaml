description: |
  Call when a PC completes a quest
remarks: |
  Calls SetLocalIntOnAll, SetLocalInt on the PC, takes the plot and quest items and gives the reward item. 
  This is part of BioWare's quest handling system. Unless you delve thoroughly into that system, and use it all the time, you probably won't need this function.
