description: |
  Handles the dragon's talent choice (random) to use in combat and makes sure they do not continously rain down Breath Weapons.
remarks: |
  The process for this function is as follows: 
  Check to see if the target passed to the function is still valid 
  If not, find a new target 
  See if the Dragon can use his breath attack yet (can only be used every three rounds). 
  If the dragon can, then use the breath weapon 
  Turn his breath weapon off for two more rounds 
  If he cant use his breath weapon then choose a random talent from the TALENT_CATEGORY_HARMFUL_MELEE talent group 
  If the talent chosen is the Feat Disarm but the target has no weapons to disarm just attack the target normally. 
  Otherwise use the talent chosen on the target. 
  Set the Breath weapon one step closer to being used. 
  This function is actually located in x0_i0_talent, but including nw_i0_generic will suffice.
