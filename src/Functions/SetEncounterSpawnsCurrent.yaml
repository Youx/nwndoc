type: Function
name: SetEncounterSpawnsCurrent
shortdesc: Sets the number of times that an encounter has spawned.
return: void
parameters:
  - type: int
    name: nNewValue
    desc: | The new number of times the encounter has spawned.

  - type: object
    name: oEncounter
    default: OBJECT_SELF
    desc: | The encounter to change the value of. (Default: OBJECT_SELF)

description: |
  Sets the number of times that oEncounter has spawned so far.
remarks: |
  The spawn-part of an encounter fires BEFORE the encounter's OnEnter does. Thus, if you call this in the OnEnter event, it will not have any effect on the group being spawned. You can draw a trigger around the encounter and call this function from OnEnter of that trigger instead as a workaround.
