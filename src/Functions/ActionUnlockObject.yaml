type: Function
name: ActionUnlockObject
shortdesc: Causes a creature to unlock a door or other locked object.
return: void
parameters:
  - type: object
    name: oTarget
    desc: | Door or placeable object that will be the target of the unlock attempt.

description: |
  The action subject will unlock oTarget which can be a door or a placeable object. ActionUnlockObject represents an object's use of the 'Open Locks' skill, and is therefore not applicable to placeables, triggers or doors themselves.
remarks: |
  Used in the script of a creature (or assigned to a creature) it will move that creature to the door and use its Open Locks skill to attempt to unlock the door (or placeable).
bugs: |
  Doors cannot lock or unlock themselves using this command, but trying to make them do so will not crash the game, as it used to. You can use ActionDoCommand(SetLocked(OBJECT_SELF, FALSE)); in a door's script as a substitute for ActionUnlockObject().
