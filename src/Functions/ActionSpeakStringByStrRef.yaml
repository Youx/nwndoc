shortdesc: Causes the creature to speak a translated string.
return: void
parameters:
  - type: int

    desc: | Reference of the string in the talk table

  - type: int

description: |
  Causes the calling creature to speak a translated string with the nStrRef index from the Talk Table.
remarks: |
  The StrRef is an index number into the user's dialog.tlk file, which is a language specific file. Since Hordes of the Underdark, it's become possible to easily make your own tlk file and include with your module. Note that you must add 16777216 to the index in your file, so if you want entry 1 in your custom tlk file, you'll need use 16777217 for the nStrRef in this function.
