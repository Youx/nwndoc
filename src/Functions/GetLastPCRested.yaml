shortdesc: Returns the last PC that rested.
return: object
parameters:
description: |
  Get the last PC that has rested in the module. This function is useful only in a module's OnPlayerRest event script, and can be used when providing custom rest behavior.
remarks: |
  It should never be used elsewhere, other then a OnPlayerRest script. It can be an invalid object - if the PC has exited the game, and the rest has been cancled. 
  NPC's do not trigger the event at all, but DM's can.
