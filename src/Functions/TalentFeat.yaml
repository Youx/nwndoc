type: Function

return: talent
parameters:
  - type: int
    name: nFeat
    desc: | FEAT_*

description: |
  Creates a talent out of a feat constant. This is used in conjunction with various talent abilities to determine the best action the AI should attempt. 
  This should not be used - it doesn't currently work.
remarks: |
  It should do the same as ActionUseFeat(), but currently is broken and using it doesn't work in anyway whatsoever. Definatly use ActionUseFeat() until it is fixed or removed.
bugs: |
  Currently, anytime this is used, it is invalid and if passed into ActionUseTalent, it will result in the NPC not doing anything and standing there.
