description: |
  Returns the object that last damaged the caller. 
  Returns OBJECT_INVALID if the caller is not a valid object, or if the caller is undamaged.
remarks: |
  Unlike most other GetLast* functions, GetLastDamaged is NOT restricted to the OnDamaged event script; it can apparently be called from any script which is "owned" by the creature that was damaged.
