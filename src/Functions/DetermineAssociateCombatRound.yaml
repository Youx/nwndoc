  This function is found in nw_i0_assoc.nss and is the reason why that include file doesnâ€™t work! The source code for the function looks as such: 
  void DetermineAssociateCombatRound() 
  { 
  int nClass = GetClassByPosition(1); 
  DetermineCombatRound(nClass); 
  DebugSTR("I should be fighting"); 
  } 
  DetermineCombatRound requires an object before any integer fed to it, and indeed, trying to compile any script that includes nw_i0_assoc will produce a compile error.
