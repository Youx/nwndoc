type: Function
name: ItemPropertyMaxRangeStrengthMod
shortdesc: Sets a mighty itemproperty.
return: itemproperty
parameters:
  - type: int
    name: nModifier
    desc: | Maximum allowed strength modifier; 1 to 20 are valid.

description: |
  Sets item property Max range strength modification (ie. mighty). You must specify the maximum modifier for strength that is allowed on a ranged weapon. 
  The modifier should be a positive integer between 1 and 20.
remarks: |
  This itemproperty, usually known as mighty, allows you to add the strength modifier of a wielder of a ranged weapon to the damage it does. You can specify the maximum allowed strength modifier. If you set the nModifier to 5, a PC using that ranged weapon and has a strength modifier of 10 will still only do 5 additional damage. 
  Also note that this is only valid for ranged weapons. 
  The itemproperty commands are special constructors - they construct an itemproperty "object" which can then be applied to an item using the AddItemProperty command, much like effects need to be first constructed, then applied with ApplyEffectToObject. 
  It will often be a good idea to remove similar itemproperties from the item first. There's a command in the "x2_inc_itemprop" include file called IPSafeAddItemProperty which will do that for you. Check IPSafeAddItemProperty for current bug report. 
  The modifier can be retrieved off this type of item property using GetItemPropertyCostTableValue.

example: |
  #include "x2_inc_itemprop"
  //The include is for the IPSafeAddItemProperty function
  //Makes the PC speaker's onhand weapon mighty +10
  //Only happens for shortbows and longbows.
  void main()
  {
  object oPC = GetPCSpeaker();
  object oItem = GetItemInSlot(INVENTORY_SLOT_RIGHTHAND, oPC);
  if (!GetIsObjectValid(oItem)) return;
  itemproperty ipAdd = ItemPropertyMaxRangeStrengthMod(10);
  switch (GetBaseItemType(oItem))
  {
      case BASE_ITEM_LONGBOW: // Note the fall-through selection scripting method
      case BASE_ITEM_SHORTBOW:
          IPSafeAddItemProperty(oItem, ipAdd); //for either case
  }
  }
