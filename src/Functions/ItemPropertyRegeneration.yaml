type: Function
name: ItemPropertyRegeneration
shortdesc: Sets a regeneration itemproperty.
return: itemproperty
parameters:
  - type: int
    name: nRegenAmount
    desc: | Regenerate by how much; 1 to 20 are valid.

description: |
  Sets item property Regeneration. You must specify the regeneration amount, which should be an integer between 1 and 20.
remarks: |
  The itemproperty commands are special constructors - they construct an itemproperty "object" which can then be applied to an item using the AddItemProperty command, much like effects need to be first constructed, then applied with ApplyEffectToObject. 
  It will often be a good idea to remove similar itemproperties from the item first. There's a command in the "x2_inc_itemprop" include file called IPSafeAddItemProperty which will do that for you. Check IPSafeAddItemProperty for current bug report. 
  The regeneration value can be retrieved off this type of item property using GetItemPropertyCostTableValue.
version: 1.61
example: |
  #include "x2_inc_itemprop"
  //The include is for the IPSafeAddItemProperty function
  //Makes the PC speaker's helmet grant a regeneration of 10
  void main()
  {
  object oPC = GetPCSpeaker();
  object oItem = GetItemInSlot(INVENTORY_SLOT_HEAD, oPC);
  if (!GetIsObjectValid(oItem)) return;
  itemproperty ipAdd = ItemPropertyRegeneration(10);
  IPSafeAddItemProperty(oItem, ipAdd);
  }
