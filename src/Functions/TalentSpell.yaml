description: |
  Create a Spell Talent. 
  This should not be used - it doesn't currently work.
remarks: |
  It should do the same as ActionCastSpell, but currently is broken and using it doesn't work in anyway whatsoever. Definatly use ActionCastSpell until it is fixed or removed. 
bugs: |
  Currently, anytime this is used, it is invalid and if passed into ActionUseTalent, it will result in the NPC not doing anything and standing there.
version: 1.30
example: |
  // Code sample invalid as TalentSpell/Feat/Skill doesn't work.
