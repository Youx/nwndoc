type: Function
name: GiveGoldToAllEqually
shortdesc: Divides a given amount of gold equally among PCs in a PC's party
return: void
parameters:
  - type: object
    name: oPC
    desc: | Player Character

  - type: int
    name: nGoldToDivide
    desc: | amount of gold to share

description: |
  Given a PC and a gold value, divides it equally among the PCs of the Player Character's party. None is given to associates. 
bugs: |
remarks: |
  Include library for party-wide functions. 
  NOTE: this library is included in "x0_i0_common" already. 
  Do NOT dual-include both files or you will get errors! 
bugs: |
  This uses GetNumberPartyMembers(), which will add one (counting the original oPC twice). 
  The work around is obvious: just get the correct # of party members, divide the gold by that amount and use GiveGoldToAll function.
requirements: |
  #include "X0_I0_PARTYWIDE"
version: 1.62
example: |
  // By using the fix above, we divide 100 gold between the oPC's
  // party as a reward for a job completed.
  // Possibly would update the journal in the same script (with a note 
  // about how much the reward was, and how poor the PC's are!)
  // If the function was fixed, we'd normally just use GiveGoldToAllEqually()
  #include "X0_I0_PARTYWIDE"
  void main()
  {
       // Get PC to reward
       object oPC = GetPCSpeaker();
       // Reward the party
       int nGold = 100;
       // Get gold for each PC
       // - Take one off GetNumberPartyMembers(), see known bugs
       int nMembers = GetNumberPartyMembers(oPC) - 1;
       // Give the correct gold to all of them
       GiveGoldToAll(oPC, nGold/nMembers);
