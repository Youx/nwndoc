shortdesc: Gets the targets Intelligence Ability Score.
return: int
parameters:
  - type: object
    name: oTarget
    desc: | The object whose Intelligence you wish to inspect.

description: |
  Returns the Intelligence Ability value of oTarget.
remarks: |
  Function can be found in nw_i0_plot.nss on line 754. 
  Very simple function, probably created so the scripters did not have to type out the full call to GetAbilityScore() each time they used it. This merely calls the GetAbilityScore(oTarget, ABILITY_INTELLIGENCE) function in that manner.
