type: Function
name: GetFirstInPersistentObject
shortdesc: Determines the first object of a specific type that is inside a persistent object.
return: object
parameters:
  - type: object
    name: oPersistentObject
    default: OBJECT_SELF
    desc: | The object that contains the object. (Default: OBJECT_SELF)

  - type: int
    name: nResidentObjectType
    default: OBJECT_TYPE_CREATURE
    desc: | OBJECT_TYPE_* (Default: OBJECT_TYPE_CREATURE)

  - type: int
    name: nPersistentZone
    default: PERSISTENT_ZONE_ACTIVE
    desc: | PERSISTENT_ZONE_ACTIVE. [This could also take the value PERSISTENT_ZONE_FOLLOW, but this is no longer used.] (Default: PERSISTENT_ZONE_ACTIVE)

description: |
  Returns the first object within oPersistentObject of the specified type in order and OBJECT_INVALID if no object is found. 
  PERSISTANT_ZONE_FOLLOW probably will no longer work, due to Bioware's own comments, and is never used. It was probably once used for mobile AOE's that are on aura's. 
  The order for things got during this is not based on range or anything, but normall works clockwise from west (0.0), but this rarely matters.
remarks: |
  Used to cycle through all of contained objects via GetNextInPersistentObject(). 
  Bioware uses this function in scripts to implement area of effect spells. 
  Also note that triggers are persistent objects, so you can cycle through objects in triggers using this command. See the code example below.
version: 1.32
example: |
  void main()
  {
  //The trigger to look in
  object oTrigger=GetObjectByTag("killer_trigger");
  //First object in that trigger. We can use bitwise |
  //Because of the values of the OBJECT_TYPE_* constants
  object oInTrigger=GetFirstInPersistentObject(oTrigger, OBJECT_TYPE_CREATURE | OBJECT_TYPE_PLACEABLE |OBJECT_TYPE_ITEM);
  while (GetIsObjectValid(oInTrigger))
     {
     DestroyObject(oInTrigger);
     oInTrigger=GetNextInPersistentObject(oTrigger, OBJECT_TYPE_CREATURE | OBJECT_TYPE_PLACEABLE |OBJECT_TYPE_ITEM);
     }
  }
