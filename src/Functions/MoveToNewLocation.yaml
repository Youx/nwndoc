type: Function
name: MoveToNewLocation
shortdesc: Tells the object to move to a new location
return: void
parameters:
  - type: location
    name: lNewLocation
    default: none
    desc: | Location to Move To (Default: none)

  - type: object
    name: oTarget
    default: OBJECT_SELF
    desc: | Object to Move (Default: OBJECT_SELF)

description: |
  This is a convenience function that places two commands in the target objects queue using two AssignCommand calls. The first wraps 
  ActionMoveToLocation(lNewLocation, FALSE). 
  The second wraps 
  ActionDoCommand(SetFacing(GetFacingFromLocation(lNewLocation)) 
  These two commands effectively command the target to move to the new location, then instructs the target to face the correct way once they get there. The default target is OBJECT_SELF. Note that the restrictions to AssignCommand, ActionMoveToLocation, and SetFacing still apply. 
  Calls 
  void SetFacing(float fFacing) 
  void ActionDoCommand(action aActionToDo) 
  float GetFacingFromLocation(location loc):float 
  void AssignCommand(object oTarget, action aActionToDo) 
  void ActionMoveToLocation(location lNewLocation, int bRun)
