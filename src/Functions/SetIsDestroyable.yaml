type: Function
name: SetIsDestroyable
shortdesc: Sets whether an object is destroyable.
return: void
parameters:
  - type: int
    name: bDestroyable
    desc: | If this is FALSE, the caller does not fade out on death, but sticks around as a corpse.

  - type: int
    name: bRaiseable
    default: TRUE
    desc: | If this is TRUE, the caller can be raised via resurrection. (Default: TRUE)

  - type: int
    name: bSelectableWhenDead
    default: FALSE
    desc: | If this is TRUE, the caller is selectable after death. (Default: FALSE)

description: |
  Sets the destroyable status of the caller. 
  If bDestroyable is FALSE, the body does not fade away and corpse is left, otherwise the body fades away. 
  If bRaiseable is TRUE the caller of this function can be raised via resurrection. 
  If bSelectableWhenDead is TRUE, then when the caller of this function is dead, players when moving their mouse over the corpse will see the name of the creature.
remarks: |
  If bSelectableWhenDead is set to TRUE, it does not mean that the corpse will be lootable by clicking on it to see its inventory. Creatures drop their inventory as loot only when they disintegrate. 
  This cannot be used on a PC. Also note that it must be assigned to a target, it has no parameter for who the target is! There is also no way to check if they are destroyable. 
  If you set an object to be undestroyable (which according to the documentation only affects what happens upon death) the object will also be unaffected by DestroyObject. It is therefore important to only set 
  SetIsDestroyable(TRUE) at the moment of the object's death.
version: 1.28
example: |
  // In the OnSpawn of a creature - this makes them, basically,
  // eyecandy and will make them undestroyable and kill them.
  // - It won't be selectable or raiseable either.
  void main()
  {
      object oSelf = OBJECT_SELF;
      // Set to Undestroyable, unraiseable, unselectable
      SetIsDestroyable(FALSE, FALSE, FALSE);
      // Apply a death effect as so we die
      effect eDeath = EffectDeath();    
      ApplyEffectToObject(DURATION_TYPE_INSTANT, eDeath, oSelf);
  }
