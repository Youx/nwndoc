description: |
  Create a Resurrection effect. This should be applied as an instantaneous effect. 
  This, when applied to any NPC or PC who is at -10 or lower hit points (dead, not just dying) gets put back to 1 hit point. 
  The target this effect is applied to must be a creature for it to work. This effect can only be applied instantly.
remarks: |
  PC's who are dead (at -11 hit points or lower) can always be raise, however, only creatures who are correctly destroyable via. the use of SetDestroyable() will work with this effect - be careful with henchmen in this sense. 
  For a proper "Resurrection" to full hit points, you need to use EffectHeal after applying EffectResurrection, as this doesn't do any healing, nor any penalties for actually being raised. 
  If applied to an alive creature, or a non-creature, it will just fail with no message. 
  Effect functions are Constructors, which are special methods that help construct effect "objects". You can declare effects, and apply them using an ApplyEffectToObject() Command. See the Effect Tutorial for more details.

example: |
  // Sample code for applying resurrection to a target,
  // not OBJECT_SELF.
  void main()
  {
      // This is the Object to apply the effect to.
      object oTarget = GetFirstPC();
      // Create the effect to apply
      effect eRaise = EffectResurrection();
      // Create the visual portion of the effect. This is instantly
      // applied and not persistant with wether or not we have the
      // above effect.
      effect eVis = EffectVisualEffect(VFX_IMP_RAISE_DEAD);
      // Apply the visual effect to the target
      ApplyEffectToObject(DURATION_TYPE_INSTANT, eVis, oTarget);
      // Apply the effect to the object   
      ApplyEffectToObject(DURATION_TYPE_INSTANT, eRaise, oTarget);
  }
