type: Function
name: AutoDC
shortdesc: Determines whether a skill check succeeds.
return: int
parameters:
  - type: int
    name: nDC
    desc: | DC_*

  - type: int
    name: nSkill
    desc: | SKILL_*

  - type: object
    name: oTarget
    desc: | The creature rolling to determine success.

description: |
  Returns TRUE if oTarget succeeds a check based on nSkill for a crude difficulty category DC.
remarks: |
  As of patch 1.30, this function will work on non-creatures as well. It uses the hitdice of the caller in a division, but if that hitdice is 0 (as for non-creature), it just divides by 1 instead.
bugs: |
  Previously noted bug was fixed in version 1.59 / patch 1.60.
requirements: |
  #include "nw_i0_plot"
version: 1.61
