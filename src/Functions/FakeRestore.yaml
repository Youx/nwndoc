type: Function
name: FakeRestore
shortdesc: Encapsulates removal of bad effects and healing of oTarget.
return: void
parameters:
  - type: object
    name: oTarget
    desc: | Target creature to heal.

description: |
  Cycles through all effects on oTarget (probably a PC) and removes them if they are “bad”, as well as heals the oPC. This is encapsulated in a function to be able to add this to the action queue.
remarks: |
  Found in nw_d1_templeheal.nss on line 14. 
  Note that nw_d1_templeheal is not an include file – you cannot include that file and then call FakeRestore from your script, because nw_d1_templeheal already has a void main() function. You can, however, copy it directly into your own script, or just the nw_d1_templeheal script for healing characters. Below is a transcription of the function:
version: 1.28
example: |
  void FakeRestore(object oTarget)
  {
      effect eVisual = EffectVisualEffect(VFX_IMP_RESTORATION_GREATER);
      effect eBad = GetFirstEffect(oTarget);
      //Search for negative effects
      while(GetIsEffectValid(eBad))
      {
          if (GetEffectType(eBad) == EFFECT_TYPE_ABILITY_DECREASE ||
