type: Function
name: GetWorkingForPlayer
shortdesc: Returns if the henchman is working for the player.
return: int
parameters:
  - type: object
    name: oPC
    desc: | The PC to check if the henchman is working for.

description: |
  Returns TRUE if the local integer "NW_L_HIRED" + the tag of the henchman (OBJECT_SELF) is set to 10 on oPC. Otherwise it returns FALSE.
remarks: |
  Found in nw_i0_henchman.nss on line 120 
  The local integer in question, as far as I could tell, will also return 10 if the henchman has been working for oPC, but isnâ€™t anymore. 
  Also note that this function uses OBJECT_SELF to identify the henchman, so it must go in a script / function owned by the henchman. 
requirements: |
