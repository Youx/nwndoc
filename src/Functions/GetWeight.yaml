description: |
  Returns the weight of an individual item. When used on a creature, returns the weight of all items combined carried by that creature (not the creature's actual weight by itself).
remarks: |
  The number returned isn’t in lbs, it’s in tenths of lbs. I tested it with a PC carrying 82 lbs worth of gear, and was shocked to learn that her weight was 818! 
  The function returns 0 on anything that isn’t an item or doesn’t have items in its inventory. A creature without anything in its inventory has a weight of 0, as does doors, invalid objects, placeables without inventories or empty inventories, etc.
