  Found in nw_j_assassin.nss on line 224 
  This is part of the Bioware assassination quest system. For it to work for you, you would have to adopt it, probably to the very last detail. This might not be the best way for you to make assassination quests, so if you don’t do it exactly the ‘Bioware-way’, you’re probably better off not using this (and similar) functions.
