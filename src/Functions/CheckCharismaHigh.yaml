type: Function
name: CheckCharismaHigh
shortdesc: Determines if the Charisma score of the speaking player is above 14.
return: int
parameters:
description: |
  Returns TRUE if the player character in the conversation has a charisma higher than 14.
remarks: |
  Function found in nw_i0_plot.nss on line 675. 
  This function always uses GetPCSpeaker() to determine the Charisma score, so using it anywhere besides in a conversation will return FALSE. This was used by BioWare to handle different conversation choices for the players depending on how charismatic they were.
requirements: |
  #include "nw_i0_plot"
version: 1.28
example: |
  //Add as a starting conditional on a conversation thread for a tavern flirt who will
  //hit on anyone with a high enough charisma.
  #include "NW_I0_PLOT"
  int StartingConditional()
  {
      int bGoodLooker = CheckCharismaHigh();
      return bGoodLooker;
  }
