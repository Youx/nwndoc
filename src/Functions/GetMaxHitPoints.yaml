type: Function
name: GetMaxHitPoints
shortdesc: Get the maximum hit points (HP) of an object.
return: int
parameters:
  - type: object
    name: oObject
    default: OBJECT_SELF
    desc: | The object whose HP are to be returned. (Default: OBJECT_SELF)

description: |
  Returns an integer that indicates the total hit points (HP) of an object. This function will return the number 0 if an error occurs (e.g., if the object has no hit points). Hit points attained through spell effects and similar devices are not counted. For example, assume a PC has the virtue spell applied to him or her, giving 1 extra HP--this would not be counted (e.g., with 52/52 HP normally but with virtue 53/52, the value 52 would be returned).
version: 1.27
example: |
  // Finds the maximum hit points for a PC
  void main()
  {
      int i = GetMaxHitPoints(GetFirstPC());
      SendMessageToPC(GetFirstPC(),IntToString(i));
  }
