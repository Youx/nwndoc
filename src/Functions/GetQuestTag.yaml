type: Function
name: GetQuestTag
shortdesc: Gets the giver's quest tag.
return: string
parameters:
  - type: object
    name: oTarget
    default: OBJECT_SELF
    desc: | Giver of the quest (Default: OBJECT_SELF)

  - type: int
    name: nQuest
    default: 1
    desc: | This quest's number (Default: 1)

description: |
  Get the tag for the given quest
remarks: |
  Takes the tag of oTarget, appends _Q and nQuest, and returns it. So, if oTarget's tag is "BOB", and nQuest is 1, this function returns BOB_Q1 - this string is used by other functions as a local variable name. 
  This is part of BioWare's quest handling system. Unless you delve thoroughly into that system, and use it all the time, you probably won't need this function.
