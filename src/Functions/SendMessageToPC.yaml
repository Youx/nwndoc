description: |
  Send a 'Combat Message' string (sMessage) to the oPlayer. Messages appear as yellow text in any chat windows that display combat messages.
remarks: |
  Useful tool for debugging scripts; you can use it to display the value of variables, position within a script, etc. 
  If you attempt to send too many SendMessageToPC() commands at the same time the messages will begin to be dropped, causing some of the messages to not appear at all. 
  It is possible to have the messages appear in all sorts of colors. It is very easy, but it requires a little more than just scripting. You can download a small demo-module with documentation on how to do this at this url:

  }
