description: |
  This function determines, using some random chance, which of the PCs three classes it should use to determine which treasure to spawn.
remarks: |
  Used within the item creation include file (nw_i0_coninclude), this function does exactly the same as nw_i0_generic's DetermineClassToUse, except it takes a parameter, which means that this function can more easily be used on PCs.
requirements: |
  #include "NW_O2_CONINCLUDE"
