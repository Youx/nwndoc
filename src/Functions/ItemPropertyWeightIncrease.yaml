type: Function
name: ItemPropertyWeightIncrease
shortdesc: Sets an increased weight itemproperty.
return: itemproperty
parameters:
  - type: int
    name: nWeight
    desc: | IP_CONST_WEIGHTINCREASE_*

description: |
  Sets item property Weight increase. You must specify the weight increase constant (IP_CONST_WEIGHTINCREASE_*).
remarks: |
  The itemproperty commands are special constructors - they construct an itemproperty "object" which can then be applied to an item using the AddItemProperty command, much like effects need to be first constructed, then applied with ApplyEffectToObject. 
  It will often be a good idea to remove similar itemproperties from the item first. There's a command in the "x2_inc_itemprop" include file called IPSafeAddItemProperty which will do that for you. Check IPSafeAddItemProperty for current bug report. 
  The IP_CONST_WEIGHTINCREASE_* value can be retrieved off this type of item property using GetItemPropertyParam1Value.
version: 1.61
example: |
  #include "x2_inc_itemprop"
  //The include is for the IPSafeAddItemProperty function
  //Makes the PC speaker's weapon pretty heavy...
  void main()
  {
  object oPC = GetPCSpeaker();
  object oItem = GetItemInSlot(INVENTORY_SLOT_RIGHTHAND, oPC);
  if (!GetIsObjectValid(oItem)) return;
  itemproperty ipAdd = ItemPropertyWeightIncrease(IP_CONST_WEIGHTINCREASE_100_LBS);
  IPSafeAddItemProperty(oItem, ipAdd);
  }
