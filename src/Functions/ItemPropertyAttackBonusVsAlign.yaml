type: Function
name: ItemPropertyAttackBonusVsAlign
shortdesc: Sets an "attack bonus versus alignment group" itemproperty.
return: itemproperty
parameters:
  - type: int
    name: nAlignGroup
    desc: | IP_CONST_ALIGNMENTGROUP_*

  - type: int
    name: nBonus
    desc: | Attack bonus; 1 to 20 are valid.

description: |
  Sets item property Attack bonus vs. alignment group, such as Lawful or Evil. You must specify the alignment group constant (IP_CONST_ALIGNMENTGROUP_*) and the attack bonus, which should be an integer between 1 and 20.
remarks: |
  The itemproperty commands are special constructors - they construct an itemproperty "object" which can then be applied to an item using the AddItemProperty command, much like effects need to be first constructed, then applied with ApplyEffectToObject. 
  It will often be a good idea to remove similar itemproperties from the item first. There's a command in the "x2_inc_itemprop" include file called IPSafeAddItemProperty which will do that for you. Check IPSafeAddItemProperty for current bug report. 
  The IP_CONST_ALIGNMENTGROUP_* constant can be retrieved off this type of item property using GetItemPropertySubType. The bonus can be retrieved using GetItemPropertCostTableValue.
version: 1.61
example: |
  #include "x2_inc_itemprop"
  //The include is for the IPSafeAddItemProperty function
  //Grants the PC speaker's onhand weapon a +10 attack bonus against evil
  void main()
  {
  object oPC = GetPCSpeaker();
  object oItem = GetItemInSlot(INVENTORY_SLOT_RIGHTHAND, oPC);
  if (!GetIsObjectValid(oItem)) return;
  itemproperty ipAdd = ItemPropertyAttackBonusVsAlign(IP_CONST_ALIGNMENTGROUP_EVIL, 10);
  IPSafeAddItemProperty(oItem, ipAdd);
  }
