    name: oCreature
    desc: | Creature to check

description: |
  Is this creature able to be disarmed? (checks disarm flag on creature, and if the creature actually has a weapon equipped in their right hand that is droppable).
remarks: |
  Will return FALSE on error, such as a non-creature, no item, and the disarm flag on. 
  However, it will not check if the items can be dropped - if they are cursed or if the creature has them set as undroppable, then they seem to disappear if disarmed. 
  This is the only way to check the disarmable flag for a creature, although they need a valid weapon in a slot for it to check it accurately.
