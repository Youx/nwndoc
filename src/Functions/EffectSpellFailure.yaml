type: Function
name: EffectSpellFailure
shortdesc: Creates an effect that inhibits spells.
return: effect
parameters:
  - type: int
    name: nPercent
    default: 100
    desc: | Percent chance of spell failing (1 to 100). (Default: 100)

  - type: int
    name: nSpellSchool
    default: SPELL_SCHOOL_GENERAL
    desc: | Spell school that is affected (SPELL_SCHOOL_*). (Default: SPELL_SCHOOL_GENERAL)

description: |
  Returns an effect that has a chance of causing a spell to fail. Spells that are cast and fail are lost. Specific schools of spells may be affected (SPELL_SCHOOL_*) or all schools may be affected (SPELL_SCHOOL_GENERAL). To gurantee that no spell can be successfully cast in an area with this effect, apply the effect with its default parameters. 
  It is likely these do not stack, and only the highest approprate penalty applies. If this is incorrect, send a bug report in. 
  The target this effect is applied to must be a creature for it to work. This effect cannot be applied instantly, only temporarily or permanently.
remarks: |
  This effect has nothing to do with arcane spell failure you can put on items (or is naturally there via. armor). It is a seperate check, and affects the caster whenever they cast a spell in addition to normal armor checks, concentration checks and so forth. 
  Putting it to 100 will stop any spell being cast. Even 1% can be deadly to a caster. 
  This can be used to create a "magic dead-zone" as per the Time of Troubles (TSR modules FR1 through FR3).

  // Apply 100% spell failure to anyone who enters this area, after all magical effects are removed!
  void main()
  {
      // Declare effects
      effect eVis = EffectVisualEffect(VFX_IMP_BREACH);
      effect eDur = EffectVisualEffect(VFX_DUR_GLOW_LIGHT_BLUE);
      effect eAntiMag = EffectSpellFailure(100);
      eAntiMag = SupernaturalEffect(eAntiMag);
      eAntiMag = EffectLinkEffects(eDur, eAntiMag);
      // Get who to effect
      object oTarget = GetEnteringObject();
      // Must NOT be a DM or plot-flagged creature
      if(GetIsDM(oTarget) || GetPlotFlag(oTarget)) return;
      // Remove effects which are magical
      effect eCheck = GetFirstEffect(oTarget);
      while(GetIsEffectValid(eCheck))
      {
          if (GetEffectSubType(eCheck) == SUBTYPE_MAGICAL)
          {
              if (GetEffectType(eCheck) != EFFECT_TYPE_DISAPPEARAPPEAR

              {
                  RemoveEffect(oTarget, eCheck);
              }
          }
          eCheck = GetNextEffect(oTarget);
      }
      // Apply effects
      ApplyEffectToObject(DURATION_TYPE_INSTANT, eVis, oTarget);
      ApplyEffectToObject(DURATION_TYPE_PERMANENT, eAntiMag, oTarget);
  }
  // Remove any spell failure when they exit the area
  void main()

      // Remove from exiter.
      object oTarget = GetExitingObject();
      // Remove effects which are spell failure
      effect eCheck = GetFirstEffect(oTarget);
