type: Function
name: ActionUseSkill
shortdesc: Causes a creature to attempt to use a skill on another object.
return: void
parameters:
  - type: int
    name: nSkill
    desc: | SKILL_*

  - type: object
    name: oTarget
    desc: | Target to use the skill on

  - type: int
    name: nSubSkill
    default: 0
    desc: | SUBSKILL_* (Default: 0)

  - type: object
    name: oItemUsed
    default: OBJECT_INVALID
    desc: | Item to use in conjunction with the skill (Default: OBJECT_INVALID)

description: |
  Adding this action to the queue of a creature will make it attempt to use the specified skill. It will have no effect on the wrong sort of object - you cannot unlock a creature, or taunt a door. 
  The nSubSkill parameter is used for recovering, disarming and flagging traps. 
  oItemUsed must be a valid item appropriate to the skill. For example, a Healing Kit can be used with SKILL_HEAL. The creature must possess the item. 
  Use ActionUseSkill with the same parameter values on oTarget again to cause it to stop using a skill which it is currently using.
remarks: |
  Some skills can be hostile acts, and invite attacks of opportunity, e.g. SKILL_TAUNT. 
  Also note that most skills are not selectable, so really only SKILL_ANIMAL_EMPATHY, SKILL_DISABLE_TRAP, SKILL_HEAL, SKILL_OPEN_LOCK, SKILL_PICK_POCKET and SKILL_TAUNT. 
  The skills SKILL_HIDE, and SKILL_SEARCH can be toggled with SetActionMode.
bugs: |
  SKILL_SET_TRAP does not work at all with this function, and therefore NPC's can never ever set traps. 
  SKILL_PARRY also doesn't work, however, SetActionMode introduced means this would be redunant anyway.
version: 1.61
example: |
  // The NPC in conversation with a PC Attempts to heal a PC with a healing kit
  void main()
  {
      // Quick loop of inventory - get first BASE_ITEM_HEALERSKIT
      object oInventory = GetFirstItemInInventory();
      object oKit;
      while(GetIsObjectValid(oInventory))
      {
          // Get if healers kit
          if(GetBaseItemType(oInventory) == BASE_ITEM_HEALERSKIT)
          {
              oKit = oInventory;
              break;
          }
          oInventory = GetNextItemInInventory();
      }
      // Check oKit
      if(GetIsObjectValid(oKit))
      {
          // Use our heal skill.
          ActionUseSkill(SKILL_HEAL, GetPCSpeaker(), 0, oKit);
      }
  }
