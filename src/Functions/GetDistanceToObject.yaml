type: Function
name: GetDistanceToObject
shortdesc: The distance from the caller of the script to the object in meters.
return: float
parameters:
  - type: object
    name: oObject
    desc: | A valid object variable describing the object you wish to measure the distance to.

description: |
  Returns the distance from the caller of the script to the object in meters. Return value is a float of -1.0 if the object to measure to is INVALID.
remarks: |
  The measurement taken will be from whatever in game object is calling this script. 
  Note that it of course can be invalid (-1.0) if they are in different areas, one object is not something that has a distance (Area's, module's), although items probably return the distance to the person that possess it (if it is possessed by a creature).
