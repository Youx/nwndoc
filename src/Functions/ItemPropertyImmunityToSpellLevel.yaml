type: Function
name: ItemPropertyImmunityToSpellLevel
shortdesc: Sets an "immunity to spell level" itemproperty.
return: itemproperty
parameters:
  - type: int
    name: nLevel
    desc: | Immune to this level and below; 1 to 9 are valid.

description: |
  Sets item property Immunity to spell level. You must specify the level of spell to which the user will be immune. The level must be an integer between 1 and 9. By putting in a 3 it will mean the user is immune to all 3rd level and lower spells.
remarks: |
  The itemproperty commands are special constructors - they construct an itemproperty "object" which can then be applied to an item using the AddItemProperty command, much like effects need to be first constructed, then applied with ApplyEffectToObject. 
  It will often be a good idea to remove similar itemproperties from the item first. There's a command in the "x2_inc_itemprop" include file called IPSafeAddItemProperty which will do that for you. Check IPSafeAddItemProperty for current bug report. 
  The level can be retrieved off this type of item property using GetItemPropertyCostTableValue.
version: 1.61
example: |
  #include "x2_inc_itemprop"
  //The include is for the IPSafeAddItemProperty function
  //Makes the first PC's amulet grant immunity to spells of level 5 and below
  void main()
  {
  object oPC = GetFirstPC();
  object oItem = GetItemInSlot(INVENTORY_SLOT_NECK, oPC);
  if (!GetIsObjectValid(oItem)) return;
  itemproperty ipAdd = ItemPropertyImmunityToSpellLevel(5);
  IPSafeAddItemProperty(oItem, ipAdd);
  }
