description: |
  Returns an event which triggers the "SpellCastAt" script. nSpell is a constant of SPELL_* which specifies the type of spell that is cast. 
  In the On Spell Cast At script, yhe parameter bHarmful is returned by GetLastSpellHarmful(), oCaster is returned by GetLastSpellCaster(), and nSpell is returned by GetLastSpell().
remarks: |
  This event must then be signaled using SignalEvent. 
  This doesn't actually cast the spell, it just makes the object that the event is signaled to behave as if it were. 
  If a spell script doesn't fire any event, then the AI will not even notice a spell was cast (and would only react to damage out of all the effects that could be applied).
version: 1.64
example: |
  // Makes us think that Magic Missile (a hostile spell) was cast
  // on ourselves, by ourselves. Not a very good example, but it is
  // one none the less.
  void main()
  {
      // Note: Ususally, this is all used on one line, because it is easier.
      SignalEvent(OBJECT_SELF, EventSpellCastAt(OBJECT_SELF, SPELL_MAGIC_MISSILE, TRUE));
