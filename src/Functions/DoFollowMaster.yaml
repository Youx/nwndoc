  Make the henchman approach its master if it is too far away, depending on the distance it has been asked to keep
remarks: |
  nw_i0_assoc.nss: 25 
  While probably a very sound function, you will never be using this, at least not from nw_i0_assoc, because of the fact that that include file has an error which means that you can never compile any scripts using this as an include.
bugs: |
  Will not work from nw_i0_assoc, for the reasons noted under remarks.
requirements: |
  #include "nw_i0_assoc"
version: 1.28
