  This function is found in the default OnPlayerRespawn script: nw_o0_respawn. This is NOT an include file, so in order to use it outside of that script, you'll also have to copy the function into that other script. The source for the function is listed in the code sample below, and is still current as of version 1.61.

example: |
  // Version 1.24 source for this function
  void ApplyPenalty(object oDead)
  {
      int nXP = GetXP(oDead);
      int nPenalty = 50 * GetHitDice(oDead);
      int nHD = GetHitDice(oDead);
      // * You can not lose a level with this respawning
      int nMin = ((nHD * (nHD - 1)) / 2) * 1000;
      int nNewXP = nXP - nPenalty;
      if (nNewXP < nMin)
         nNewXP = nMin;
      SetXP(oDead, nNewXP);
      int nGoldToTake =    FloatToInt(0.10 * GetGold(oDead));
      // * a cap of 10 000gp taken from you
      if (nGoldToTake > 10000)
      {
          nGoldToTake = 10000;
      }
      AssignCommand(oDead, TakeGoldFromCreature(nGoldToTake, oDead, TRUE));
      DelayCommand(4.0, FloatingTextStrRefOnCreature(58299, oDead, FALSE));
      DelayCommand(4.8, FloatingTextStrRefOnCreature(58300, oDead, FALSE));
