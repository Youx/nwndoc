type: Function
name: GetLastSpeaker
shortdesc: Determines the last creature that was communicated with.
return: object
parameters:
description: |
  Use this in a conversation script to get the person with whom the PC is conversing. Returns OBJECT_INVALID if the caller is not a valid creature.
remarks: |
  If called within a conversation (e.g., as part of the "StartingConditional" script for a PC line of text AFTER the NPC has spoken previously), the function will not return the last NPC speaker, but will return OBJECT_INVALID. 
  The value is apparently set after the whole conversation with an NPC is completed, not after each line of conversation. This means you can't use this function during a conversation to grab the tag of the NPC that is speaking.
