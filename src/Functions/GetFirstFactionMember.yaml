type: Function
name: GetFirstFactionMember
shortdesc: Obtains the first member of the faction that a creature is a member of.
return: object
parameters:
  - type: object
    name: oMemberOfFaction
    desc: | Creature to determine which faction we want.

  - type: int
    name: bPCOnly
    default: TRUE
    desc: | If TRUE then the returned faction member will be a PC, otherwise both NPCs and PCs are included in the search. (Default: TRUE)

description: |
  Returns the first member of oMemberOfFaction's faction and OBJECT_INVALID if oMemberOfFaction or oMemberOfFaction's faction is invalid. If bPCOnly is set to FALSE it only includes NPCs, NOT both. To get all members of a PC's faction (Henchmen and so forth, as well as PC's themselves) 2 loops of the faction must be done.
remarks: |
  This function begins to cycle through all oMemberOfFaction's faction by calling GetNextFactionMember(). 
  If bPCOnly is TRUE the returned faction member will be a PC. If bPCOnly is FALSE, it will only do non-PC faction members. 
  Never use this on an NPC faction! There would be dozens more objects in even the smallest custom faction compared to a PC party. If used, use with caution!
version: 1.29
example: |
  // This code shows how you can cycle through all the party 
  // members of the first PC in the module.
  // This will ONLY get PC members - any associates (Henchmen,
  // familiars, summoned creatures and so on) will not be got by
  // this loop. If the bPCOnly was FALSE in this script, it would ONLY
  // get henchmen, familiars and so on for the faction.
  void main()
  {
      // We alway use the SAME object for the GetFirst/Next faction 
      // member calls - always define it first. Here it is the first PC.
      object oPC = GetFirstPC();
      // Get the first PC party member
      object oPartyMember = GetFirstFactionMember(oPC, TRUE);
      // We stop when there are no more valid PC's in the party.
      while(GetIsObjectValid(oPartyMember) == TRUE)
      {
          // Do something to party member
          // Get the next PC member of oPC's faction.
          // If we put anything but oPC into this, it may be a totally
          // unreliable loop!
          oPartyMember = GetNextFactionMember(oPC, TRUE);
      }
