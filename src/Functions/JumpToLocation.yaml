type: Function
name: JumpToLocation
shortdesc: This is a command to move instantly to the location referenced by lLocation.
return: void
parameters:
  - type: location
    name: locDestination
description: |
  This is a command, thus it is only valid when used in a AssignCommand(object oObject, JumpToLocation(locLocation)); call. This command is then put in the top of the referenced objects command queue, causing the object to immediately jump to the specified location. The action is added to the TOP of the action queue.
remarks: |
  Even though this command should appear at the top of the action queue, it might be a good idea to clear all of the intended target's actions first with ClearAllActions(). 
  When a PC leaves an Area or Trigger because you've jumped to a location causes the OnExit event of the departed object to fire. 
  Does not affect creatures that are dead; they must have HP above 0 for this function to work properly.
version: 1.29
example: |
  void main()
  {
     object oPC = GetFirstPC();
     object oArea = GetArea(OBJECT_SELF);
     vector vPosition = Vector(20.0, 20.0, 0.0);
     float fAngle = 90.0;
     location locTarget = Location(oArea, vPosition, fAngle);
     AssignCommand(oPC, JumpToLocation(locTarget)); 
  }
