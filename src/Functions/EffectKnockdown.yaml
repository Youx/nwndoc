description: |
  Create a Knockdown effectThis effect knocks creatures off their feet, they will sit until the effect is removed. This should be applied as a temporary effect with a 3 second duration minimum (1 second to fall, 1 second sitting, 1 second to get up). 
  Knockdown makes a creature prone - dodge AC, dexterity bonuses will not apply and any attacks can be automatic sneak attacks, as they will not be able to react to a sneak attack. 
  Knockdown stops movement and plays a special animation - there is no need for a visual effect. Very few models/monsters do not have a "Knockdown" state. 
  The target this effect is applied to must be a creature for it to work. This effect cannot be applied instantly or permanently, only temporarily. This is mainly because knockdown does have a standing animation and is hard to remove otherwise.
remarks: |
  Knockdown is countered by, either high disiplin for the feats Knockdown and Improved Knockdown, or Immunity: Knockdown. 
  Knockdown is very powerful - yes, mainly because it is a feat (which represents the P&P "trip" I think), but it does have the similar effect on casters as any thing that stops them moving or casting spells - almost death. 
  Knockdown, when removed, shouldl normally stand up, not instantly go to standing. However, the effect type when GetEffectType() is used is 0 - which is the same for a few other effects.
bugs: |
  The bug that caused the game to crash if this effect was applied to a non-creature has been fixed in a patch some time ago. 
  This returns 0 for GetEffectType(), it could be intended, but its hard to remove any knockdown without a unique constant!
version: 1.62
example: |
  // Sample code for applying knockdown (10 seconds) to a target
  void main()
  {
      // This is the Object to apply the effect to.
      object oTarget = OBJECT_SELF;
      // Create the effect to apply
      effect eKnockdown = EffectKnockdown();
      // Create the visual portion of the effect. This is instantly
      // applied and not persistant with wether or not we have the
      // above effect.
      effect eVis = EffectVisualEffect(VFX_IMP_PULSE_WIND);
      // Apply the visual effect to the target
      ApplyEffectToObject(DURATION_TYPE_INSTANT, eVis, oTarget);
      // Apply the effect to the object   
      ApplyEffectToObject(DURATION_TYPE_TEMPORARY, eKnockdown, oTarget, 10.0);
  }
