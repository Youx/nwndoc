type: Function
name: IPGetIsMeleeWeapon
shortdesc: Checks if an item is a melee weapon.
return: int
parameters:
  - type: object
    name: oItem
    desc: | Object to check whether is a melee weapon.

description: |
  Returns TRUE if oItem is a melee weapon.
remarks: |
  Checks the base item type against the list of types that are known to be melee weapons. 
  Previously noted was that !GetWeaponRanged() could be used. Of course, this can only be used if the object tested is definatly a weapon of some sort (for example, the object right hand). In some cases (for example, the left hand) this cannot be always tested sucessfully, and this function can be used instead.
requirements: |
  #include "x2_inc_itemprop"
version: 1.62
example: |
  // Speak something if the PC speaker has a melee weapon
  // equipped.
  // Conversation action.
  #include "x2_inc_itemprop"
  void main()
  {
      // Get PC Speaker
      object oPC = GetPCSpeaker();
      // Get object in right hand
      object oObject = GetItemInSlot(INVENTORY_SLOT_RIGHTHAND, oPC);
      // Check if melee weapon, or not.
      if(IPGetIsMeleeWeapon(oItem))
      {
          // Speak a (not at all witty) response
          SpeakString("Armed for melee fights eh? Well good luck to you! You'll need it!");
      }
