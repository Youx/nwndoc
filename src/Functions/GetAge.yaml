type: Function
name: GetAge
shortdesc: Determines the age of a creature.
return: int
parameters:
  - type: object
    name: oCreature
    desc: | Creature to get the age from.

description: |
  Returns oCreature's age and 0 if oCreature is invalid.
remarks: |
  This can be used as a clever way to determine if a creature is a PC since NPCs do not have ages. See the addition code sample below for more information. 
  Of course, GetIsPC is more useful! A PC can set thier age to 0 if they wished! 
  Obviously, oCreature is invalid if it is anything other then a creature.
version: 1.29
example: |
  // biased example for trusting a certain age group :)
  int TrustCreature(object oCreature)
  {
     if (GetAge(oCreature) >= 30)
        return FALSE; // Over 30? Can't be trusted.
     return TRUE;
  }
  // clever way to determine if a creature is a PC
  int NewIsPC(object oCreature)
  {
       if (GetAge(oCreature) != 0)
            return TRUE;
       else
            return FALSE;
  }
