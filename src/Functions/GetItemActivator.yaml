type: Function
name: GetItemActivator
shortdesc: Retrieve the creature which activated an item.
return: object
parameters:
description: |
  Returns object that activated an item. Use this in a module's OnActivateItem event script to get the creature that activated the item.
remarks: |
  This function should only be used in the module's OnActivateItem event script, because that's the only place it makes sense to refer to an activated item. 
  Note that "item" refers to inventory objects. You can't use OnActivateItem to refer to a placeable object, such as a trap or switch. In those cases, use the placeable object's OnUsed event, or the trap's OnEnter event.
