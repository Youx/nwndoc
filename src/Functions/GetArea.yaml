type: Function
name: GetArea
shortdesc: Returns the area oTarget is currently in.
return: object
parameters:
  - type: object
    name: oTarget
    desc: | The area that the target is located.

description: |
  Returns the area that oTarget is currently in where oTarget can be a PC, creature, or placeable. 
  Returns OBJECT_INVALID on any error.
remarks: |
  If the area for a known creature is invalid, it is probably in limbo! Doing anything to it when it is in limbo may well crash the game (especially DelayCommanded actions). 
  If a PC's area is invalid, it can only be in an area tansition - almost like Limbo - and may also cause a crash if thier action queue is edited, or so on. 
  If called on an area, it returns the area itself. So, if OBJECT_SELF is an area, (GetArea(OBJECT_SELF)==OBJECT_SELF)
version: 1.62
example: |
  // Get the are of the script caller. If this is an area or module, 
  // it will obviously be invalid!
  void main()
  {
      // Define the oArea object variable.
      object oArea;
      // Get the area of the script caller.
      oArea = GetArea(OBJECT_SELF);
  }
