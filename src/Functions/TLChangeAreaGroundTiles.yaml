  - type: int
    name: nRows
    desc: | Rows in the area

  - type: float
    name: fZOffset

description: |
  change the type of the ground or (by default) sub ground tiles (i.e. water) to the specified type.
remarks: |
  This function will flood the entire area with the tile in question. nColumns and nRows indicate the size of the area. For instance, a 4 * 6 area will have 4 columns and 6 rows. 
  You may not want to flood your entire area, but this function will give you a pretty good idea how to use the tile magic (tm). Basically, you just create an invisible object in the center of a tile, and apply a permanent visual effect to that invisible object.
