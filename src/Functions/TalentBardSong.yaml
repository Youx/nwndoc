shortdesc: If the AI has the Bard Song Feat use it.
return: int
parameters:
description: |
  Returns TRUE to the calling function if the creature has a Bard Song Feat and uses it.
remarks: |
  The SoU version of this function is in x0_i0_talent â€“ including nw_i0_generic will still work, though. 
  If the caller of the function already has the spell effect from the spell bard song (referenced by row number 411 in spells.2da, but without a corresponding constant value in nwscript.nss), the function will automatically return FALSE.
