type: Function
name: GetFactionAverageLevel
shortdesc: Get the average level of the members of the faction.
return: int
parameters:
  - type: object
    name: oFactionMember
    desc: | The object whose faction you wish to examine.

description: |
  Returns an integer corresponding to the average level of all the creatures in the object's faction. 
  Return value on error: -1 
  It is unknown if NPC's in a PC's faction affects this function call and the returned result, such sa summoned monsters, henchmen and familiars, or if those creatures can be used as the oFactionMember at all.
remarks: |
  "level" will be basically thier hit dice. To get a more accurate reading of where they are between levels, for example, it could be that they are very nearly the next level, use GetFactionAverageXP(). 
  This will work exactly the same was as using GetFirst/NextFactionMemeber() and using GetHitDice(), only is much easier to code and probably better on performance. 
  Try to never use this on an NPC faction, only a PC's party faction, because NPC factions usually have dozens of NPC's, and thus may cause a lot of high CPU usage with faction calls such as this.

example: |
  // Give experience based on the average level of the PC's party.
  // Give 250 per the average level, so if a party had a average level
  // of 10, it'd be 2500 XP each.
  #include "nw_i0_tool"
  void main()
  {
      // Get the PC's party speaker
      object oPC = GetPCSpeaker();
      // Get the average level of thier party
      int nLvl = GetFactionAverageLevel(oPC);
      // Get the XP to award
      int nXP = nLvl * 250;    
      // Give the XP to the PC's
      // * This function is in nw_i0_tool
      RewardPartyXP(nXP, oPC);
