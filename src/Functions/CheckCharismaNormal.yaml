shortdesc: Determines if the Charisma score of the speaking player is above 9.
return: int
parameters:
description: |
  Returns TRUE if the player character in the conversation has a Charisma score greater than 9.
remarks: |
  Function found in nw_i0_plot.nss on line 640. 
  This function always uses GetPCSpeaker() to determine the charisma score, so using it anywhere besides in a conversation will return FALSE. This was used by BioWare to handle different conversation choices for the players depending on how charismatic they were.
