description: |
  Does a single attack on every hostile creature within 10ft. of the attacker and determines damage accordingly. If the attacker has a ranged weapon equipped, this will have no effect. 
  ** NOTE ** This is meant to be called inside the spell script for whirlwind attack, it is not meant to be used to queue up a new whirlwind attack. To do that you need to call ActionUseFeat(FEAT_WHIRLWIND_ATTACK, oEnemy).
remarks: |
  As mentioned in the description, you probably won't need to use this function ever.
