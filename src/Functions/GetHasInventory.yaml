type: Function
name: GetHasInventory
shortdesc: Determine whether an object has an inventory.
return: int
parameters:
  - type: object
    name: oObject
    desc: | Creature, store or placeable to investigate.

description: |
  Returns TRUE for creatures and stores, and checks to see if an item or placeable object is a container and FALSE for all other object types.
remarks: |
  Creatures always have inventories, and cannot be toggled on/off. Stores also always have an inventory. It never returns FALSE if it just is empty. 
  For placeables, this is basically a check for the "Has inventory" toggle under the "General" tab of a placeables properties. Because of this, placeables with inventories must be useable because of how the checkboxs are done.
version: 1.22
example: |
  // Check if the nearest placeable has an inventory, if so, speak its name
  // Could be a creature heartbeat
  void main()
  {
      // Get nearest placeable
      object oPlaceable = GetNearestObject(OBJECT_TYPE_PLACEABLE);
      // Has it got an inventory?
      if(GetIsObjectValid(oPlaceable))
      {
          // If it has...
          if(GetHasInventory(oPlaceable))
          {
              // Speak about it.
              SpeakString("Hey, " + GetName(oPlaceable) + " might have something in it!");
          }
      }
