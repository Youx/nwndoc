return: string
parameters:
description: |
  Returns the plot (or journal) tag for the quest.
remarks: |
  GetPlotTag is once in every BioWare script file that controls a specific quest. This way the code that runs one quest looks very similar to another script. 
  This function is of little use for general scripting 
  needs.
