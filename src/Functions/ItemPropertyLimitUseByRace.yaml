type: Function
name: ItemPropertyLimitUseByRace
shortdesc: Sets an "only useable by race" itemproperty.
return: itemproperty
parameters:
  - type: int
    name: nRace
    desc: | IP_CONST_RACIALTYPE_*

description: |
  Sets item property Limit use by race. You must specify the race(s) who are allowed to use this item (IP_CONST_RACIALTYPE_*). 
  [LS says in the coding sample that the races are limited to the player races: Dwarf, Elf, Gnome, Halfling, Halfelf, Halforc and Human; I haven't tested this yet. - ed.]
remarks: |
  The itemproperty commands are special constructors - they construct an itemproperty "object" which can then be applied to an item using the AddItemProperty command, much like effects need to be first constructed, then applied with ApplyEffectToObject. 
  It will often be a good idea to remove similar itemproperties from the item first, if you are not stacking races. There's a command in the "x2_inc_itemprop" include file called IPSafeAddItemProperty which will do that for you. Check IPSafeAddItemProperty for current bug report. 
  The IP_CONST_RACIALTYPE_* value can be retrieved off this type of item property using GetItemPropertySubType.
version: 1.61
example: |
  #include "x2_inc_itemprop"
  //The include is for the IPSafeAddItemProperty function
  //Restricts the use of the PC speaker's weapon so that
  //only those of the same race can use it
  void main()
  {
  object oPC = GetPCSpeaker();
  object oItem = GetItemInSlot(INVENTORY_SLOT_RIGHTHAND, oPC);
  if (!GetIsObjectValid(oItem)) return;
  int nRace = GetRacialType(oPC);
  //Not a valid racial type for this purpose:
  if (nRace > RACIAL_TYPE_HUMAN) return;
  //The integer value for the standard PC races
  //are the same for RACIAL_TYPE_*
  //as for IP_CONST_RACIALTYPE_*, and are thus interchangeable.
  //See comments under ItemPropertyLimitUseByAlign - ed.
  itemproperty ipAdd = ItemPropertyLimitUseByRace(nRace);
  IPSafeAddItemProperty(oItem, ipAdd);
  //Note: if adding more races, use AddItemProperty - ed.
