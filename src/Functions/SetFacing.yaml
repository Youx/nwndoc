description: |
  Causes the caller of this function to face fDirection. 
  There are some predefined constants for a direction:

  DIRECTION_NORTH = 90.0 
  DIRECTION_WEST = 180.0 
  DIRECTION_SOUTH = 270.0
remarks: |
  Note that GetFacing will correctly return the facing to the nearest degree from 1.62.
bugs: |
  There are issues with setting the facing of sitting creatures.
version: 1.22
example: |
  // Used in the OnSpawn of a creature to set 
  // their facing to a random direction.
  main()
  {
     // Get a random direction from 0 to 360
     float fDirection = IntToFloat(Random(361));
     SetFacing(fDirection);
  }
