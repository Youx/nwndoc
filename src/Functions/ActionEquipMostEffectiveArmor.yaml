type: Function
name: ActionEquipMostEffectiveArmor
shortdesc: Causes the calling creature to equip the best armor in its inventory.
return: void
parameters:
description: |
  The calling creature will equip the armor in its possession that has the highest armor class. Remember, in combat, a creature cannot change its armor.
remarks: |
  As with all ActionEquip* functions, it is not necessary to first unequip the current item in the same inventory slot before equipping the new item. 
  Also note that Clothing, with 0 AC, will, for some reason, not be equipped. Only padded armor or better (even with AC bonuses/decreases) will get equipped. 
  See the second example code for how to equip the first armor found, thus any clothing will be equipped.
bugs: |
  Not really a bug, but intended, as noted above, any clothing (still "armor") is not equipped, even if it has a positive AC bonus. Because the base AC is 0, it is not considered proper armor by this function.
version: 1.62
example: |
  // When we are ordered to, in a conversation, to "Prepare for
  // battle", by the PC, we equip our best armor (we should have
  // some armor in our inventory, and be wearing something 
  // worse (eg: clothes) currently).
  // It will also equip the biggest bestest ranged weapon, or lacking
  // that, melee weapon we have.
  void main()
  {
      // Stop what we are doing, do the equipping
      ClearAllActions();
      SpeakString("Um, I'm now ready, you know...to fight...");
      ActionEquipMostDamagingRanged();
      ActionEquipMostEffectiveArmor();
  }
  // Example 2
  // This will equip any armor in the entering objects inventory.
  // Ceasily be modified to be used on a NPC's spawn script, but
  // this is a good thing to have as a trigger around the module
  // spawn point for PC's.
  // Thanks to georage.
  void main()
  {
      // Get the entering object
      object oPC = GetEnteringObject();
      string sLocal = "DO_ONCE" + ObjectToString(OBJECT_SELF);
      // Only do this once, only affects PC's
      if(GetLocalInt(oPC, sLocal) || !GetIsPC(oPC)) return;
      // Set to not do it again
      SetLocalInt(oPC, sLocal, TRUE);
      // Loop the objects inventory and equip the first
      object oItem = GetFirstItemInInventory(oPC);
      while(GetIsObjectValid(oItem))
      {
          // Check if armor, of course
          if(GetBaseItemType(oItem) == BASE_ITEM_ARMOR)
          {
              // Equip it and stop the script
              AssignCommand(oPC, ActionEquipItem(oItem, INVENTORY_SLOT_CHEST));
              return;
          }
          oItem = GetNextItemInInventory(oPC);
      }
  }
