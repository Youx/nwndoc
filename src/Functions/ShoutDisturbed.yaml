description: |
  Does two separate checks to see whether the container has been destroyed, or just opened. The only difference is the PC identifier method (LastAttacker / LastOpener). 
  The function then sends out a spherical 'shout' to all creatures within that are of the containers faction. It makes all faction members within to temporary enemy status towards the PC.
