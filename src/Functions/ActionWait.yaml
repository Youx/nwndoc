type: Function
name: ActionWait
shortdesc: Adds a wait action to an objects queue.
return: void
parameters:
  - type: float
    name: fSeconds
    default: 0.0
    desc: | Time, in seconds, to wait. (Default: 0.0)

description: |
  Adding ActionWait() to an object action queue causes the object to pause fSeconds seconds before performing the next action in the queue.
remarks: |
  ActionWait() is useful for getting NPCs or other objects to stop what they're doing for a short amount of time before continuing a further sequence of actions. 
  N.B., ActionWait will NOT introduce a pause in the execution of your script - nothing will. If you want to delay the engine's execution of a piece of code (rather than an object's execution of an action), you should use DelayCommand() on an ExecuteScript() call instead.
version: 1.22
example: |
  /* This code in an NPC's script will queue a set of actions to
   * make the NPC walk to a waypoint ("WP_LOOKING_1"), 
   * yell "Is anyone there?", pause 5 seconds for a response, 
   * and be suitably disappointed */
  ActionMoveToObject(GetObjectByTag("WP_LOOKING_1"));
  ActionSpeakString("Is anyone there?");
  ActionWait(5.0);
  ActionSpeakString("Dang!");
  // --- NPC/NPC conversation ---
  /* This sequence of Actions in a trigger's OnEnter script
   * will simulate a short conversation between two nearby NPCs.*/
  object oFrodo = GetObjectByTag("Frodo");
  object oSam   = GetObjectByTag("Sam");
  AssignCommand(oSam, ActionWait(2.0));
  AssignCommand(oFrodo, ActionSpeakString("Oh, Sam, will we ever make it to Mordor?"));
  AssignCommand(oFrodo, ActionWait(4.0));
  AssignCommand(oSam, ActionSpeakString("Of course we will, Master Frodo, if that pesky Gollum doesn't strangle us first."));
  AssignCommand(oSam, ActionWait(4.0));
  AssignCommand(oFrodo, ActionSpeakString("You're always so cheerful, Sam. I'm glad we're pals");
  AssignCommand(oSam, ActionSpeakString("Pals? When this is over, you and I are going to have a long talk about the definition of 'walking holiday'.");
