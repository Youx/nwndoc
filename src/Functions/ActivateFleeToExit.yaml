type: Function
name: ActivateFleeToExit
shortdesc: Causes a creature to run to its exit waypoint and disappear.
return: void
parameters:
description: |
  ActivateFleeToExit will cause an NPC to flee to a waypoint called EXIT_ + <NPC's tag>, and then destroy itself, optionally respawning at its spawn-in location. 
  For ActionFleeToExit to work, you must set one of these four spawn-in conditions: NW_FLAG_TELEPORT_LEAVE, NW_FLAG_TELEPORT_RETURN, NW_FLAG_ESCAPE_LEAVE or NW_FLAG_ESCAPE_RETURN. 
  NPCs with the TELEPORT flags simply destroy themselves in an EFFECT_UNSUMMON effect.
remarks: |
  You can confirm that your NPC is flagged to use this function with GetFleeToExit(). 
  When using the NW_FLAG_ESCAPE_RETURN option, it is an absolute requirement that the TAG of your NPC is 100% identical to its resref. As can be seen in nw_i0_generic.nss, the ActivateFleeToExit() function uses 
  CreateSignPostNPC() (with the TAG as argument) to respawn the npc. However, that function requires the resref, and will not work at all with a tag! 
  So if an NPC's resref is "halfling016", then the NPC's tag must be "halfling016", otherwise the NPC will flee and disappear, but never return!
