  This function will set the volume of any sound object you have placed in your module. The value of nVolume can be anywhere between 0 and 127 (0 value turns a sound object off).
remarks: |
  Another function that is useful for creating mood effects. One possible use is to have a sound set very low (in the 20-30 range), then when the player(s) approach an object, turn the volume up to max.
version: 1.22
example: |
  // Assumes - CryptMoans Sound is placed nearby and has the 
  //                 volume slider set very low (or off)
  //               - Corpse is placed from placeables menu (Tagged as 
  //                 Corpse1, change if needed
  //               - This script placed in the OnDisturbed section of the 
  //                 corpse scripts
  //
  //Function description
  //  Just an example that natters at the player for looting a corpse 
  //  found in the dungeon.  Good for mood setting, guilt trips
  //  etc...  Ensure the sound you want is placed nearby and set at 
  //  very low volume.  This could lead to a whole line of things to
  //do with corpses in your dungeon.
  void main()
  {
  //get the SoundObject tag
  object mySound = GetObjectByTag("CryptMoans");
       //Natter at the player for looting the poor corpse
       ActionSpeakString("Why do you disturb my rest...",TALKVOLUME_TALK);
       //Turn moaning to Maximum, make the player jump :)
       SoundObjectSetVolume(mySound, 127);
  }
