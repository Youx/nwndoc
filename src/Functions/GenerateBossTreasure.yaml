  This function is part of the NWN Treasure Distribution System and used for generated boss-level treasure for a PC. Treasure generated in this manner is usually custom tailored to the PC (in this case oLastOpener); i.e. a 3rd level Fighter with the Weapon Focus in the Longsword might find a Longsword +1.
