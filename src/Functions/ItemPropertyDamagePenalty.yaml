type: Function
name: ItemPropertyDamagePenalty
shortdesc: Sets a damage penalty itemproperty.
return: itemproperty
parameters:
  - type: int
    name: nPenalty
    desc: | Damage penalty; 1 to 5 are valid.

description: |
  Sets item property Damage penalty. You must specify the damage penalty. The damage penalty should be a POSITIVE integer between 1 and 5: a penalty of 1 reduces the item's damaging ability by 1.
remarks: |
  The itemproperty commands are special constructors - they construct an itemproperty "object" which can then be applied to an item using the AddItemProperty command, much like effects need to be first constructed, then applied with ApplyEffectToObject. 
  It will often be a good idea to remove similar itemproperties from the item first. There's a command in the "x2_inc_itemprop" include file called IPSafeAddItemProperty which will do that for you. Check IPSafeAddItemProperty for current bug report. 
  The penalty can be retrieved off this type of item property using GetItemPropertyCostTableValue.
version: 1.61
example: |
  #include "x2_inc_itemprop"
  //The include is for the IPSafeAddItemProperty function
  //Gives the PC speaker's onhand weapon a -5 damage penalty
  void main()
  {
  object oPC=GetPCSpeaker();
  object oItem = GetItemInSlot(INVENTORY_SLOT_RIGHTHAND, oPC);
  if (!GetIsObjectValid(oItem)) return; //stop if no weapon
  itemproperty ipAdd = ItemPropertyDamagePenalty(5);
  IPSafeAddItemProperty(oItem, ipAdd);
  }
