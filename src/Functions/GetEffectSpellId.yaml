shortdesc: This will return the constant of the spell that applied the effect (SPELL_*).
return: int
parameters:
  - type: effect
    name: eSpellEffect

description: |
  Returns the constant defining the Spell used to apply this effect on the creature. 
  Will Return -1 if eSpellEffect was not applied by a spell script.
remarks: |
  You must first create and place the effect you wish to examine into a variable before calling this function. Very useful if you are looking for all the effects of a particular spell or leaving out effects of certain spells. One example could be when you wish to dispell all effects on a creature except those granted by a wish spell.
