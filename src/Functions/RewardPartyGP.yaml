remarks: |
  Found in: nw_i0_tool.nss: 170 
  Useful for rewarding an entire party for their efforts, rather than just, say, the PC talking to the quest giver. It is simply a wrapper for GiveGoldToCreature. If bAllParty is TRUE, all member’s in oTarget’s party get nGP gold pieces. Otherwise, only oTarget receives the gold.
requirements: |
  #include "nw_i0_tool"
version: 1.28
example: |
  void main()
  {
  object oPC = GetPCSpeaker();
  RewardPartyGP(1000, oPC);
  //give 1000 gold to everybody in oPC’s party
  //Or
  RewardPartyGP(1000, oPC, FALSE);
  //only give 1000 gold to oPC – exactly the same as GiveGoldToCreature(oPC, 1000);
  }
