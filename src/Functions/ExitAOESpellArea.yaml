  This is experimental and has not been looked at closely.

  nw_i0_generic.nss: 3360 
  This function is apparently never used in the official campaign. First, it clears the callers action queue. Then, it makes the caller run to a distance of 5 m from oAOEObject. Then, it calls DetermineCombatRound to have the caller continue fighting.
