return: int
parameters:
  - type: object
    name: oTarget
    default: OBJECT_SELF
    desc: | The creature to inspect for gold. (Default: OBJECT_SELF)

description: |
  Returns the amount of gold possessed by oTarget.
remarks: |
  This simply is an integer value - noting that gold weighs nothing. 
  It should be possible to put oTarget as something other then a creature (say, a chest) but this hasn't been tested.

example: |
  // This can be used to only say a line in a conversation if the
  // speaker has 100gp or more.
  int StartingConditional()
  {
     int iResult;
     iResult = (GetGold(GetPCSpeaker()) >= 100);
     return iResult;
  }
