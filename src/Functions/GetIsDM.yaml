shortdesc: Determines whether a creature is a DM avatar.
return: int
parameters:
  - type: object
    name: oCreature
    desc: | The creature to determine if it is a DM avatar.

description: |
  Returns TRUE if oCreature is a DM (Dungeon Master) avatar. Returns FALSE for everything else, including creatures controlled by the DM. 
  If you check the master of the target with this, it will actually be the same as GetIsDMPossessed(), and was a workaround until it appeared. 
  To determine wether the creature is controlled by a DM, use GetIsDMPossessed().
