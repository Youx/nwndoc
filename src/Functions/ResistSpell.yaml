  * Return value if oCaster or oTarget is an invalid object: FALSE

  Bioware uses MyResistSpell() for spells that use this, to apply appropriate effects for the return value. It is a good idea to use this wrapper function instead of this directly. The Bioware function only returns 1 or 0.
remarks: |
  This should only ever be used in a spell script! It may not work correctly elsewhere, as Mantals and Globes use the spells level, if it is a PC spell (defined in spells.2da), to stop this or decrease the amount of mantal power, and the caster level of oCaster of course! 
  It checks spell resistance, Globes, and Spell Immunity. 
  IE, the effects EffectSpellImmunity, EffectSpellResistanceIncrease, EffectSpellLevelAbsorption (Or approprate item properties). See seperate descriptions for exact effects. 
  Never use it for non-player spells (defined in the spells.2da), it mearly always returns -1 (as it would for a non-spell-script!)
bugs: |
