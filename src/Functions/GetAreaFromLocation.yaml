type: Function
name: GetAreaFromLocation
shortdesc: Returns the area that a particular location is in.
return: object
parameters:
  - type: location
    name: lLocation
    default: None
    desc: | The location (Default: None)

description: |
  Get the area's object ID from lLocation. 
  The function GetArea would generally be used more often, as it's parameter is an object, rather than a location, but GetAreaFromLocation is useful when a location is being manipulated. For example, when a new location is needed based on the facing, and/or the position of an existing location.
remarks: |
  If the location provided isn't valid, the function returns OBJECT_INVALID. 
  It is a good way to get if a stored GetLocalLocation() is invalid or valid - it is basically the only way to do it! If the area is valid for the local location, a creature can be sucessfully moved there without problems (where they appear is another matter).
version: 1.22
example: |
      // Get the location of the calling object
      location lMyLocation = GetLocation (OBJECT_SELF);
      // Get the area, position and facing
      object   oArea       = GetAreaFromLocation (lMyLocation);
      vector   vPosition   = GetPositionFromLocation (lMyLocation);
      float    fFacing     = GetFacingFromLocation (lMyLocation);
      // Build a new location, which faces in the opposite direction
      location lNewLocation = Location (oArea, vPosition, fFacing + 180.0);
