shortdesc: Determines the specific user-defined number that has been sent to it.
return: int
parameters:
description: |
  This is for use in a user-defined script, it gets the event number.
remarks: |
  When you signal the user defined event to be triggered, you do so using a call like: 
  event eMyEvent=EventUserDefined(3333); 
  SignalEvent(OBJECT_SELF, eMyEvent); 
  In the above case, you could then use GetUserDefinedEventNumber inside the user-defined event script, and it would return 3333.
version: 1.61
example: |
  //Example structure of a user defined event script.
  void main()
  {
  int nEvent=GetUserDefinedEventNumber();
  switch (nEvent)
     {
     case 3333:
        SpeakString("I'm in event 3333");
        break;
     case 3334:
        SpeakString("This is event 3334");
        break;
     default:
        SpeakString("I don't know what to do with this event number");
     }
  }
