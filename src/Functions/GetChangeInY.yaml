type: Function
name: GetChangeInY
shortdesc: Convenience function that calculates the change in the Y axis to the target
return: float
parameters:
  - type: float
    name: fDistance
    desc: | Distance to target

  - type: float
    name: fAngle
    desc: | Direction to target

description: |
  This is a convenience function that returns the product of fDistance*sin(fAngle) as a float. This number would than be used to calculate the amount to needed to change the Y-axis of the current location in order to reach the target location. This function would normally be used with GetChangeInX. 
  Calls 
  float Sin(float fAngle)
