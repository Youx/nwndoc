type: Function
name: SetDroppableFlag
shortdesc: Marks an item as droppable or undroppable.
return: void
parameters:
  - type: object
    name: oItem
    desc: | Item to set the droppable flag of.

  - type: int
    name: bDroppable
    desc: | Determines if the item is droppable (TRUE if it can be dropped, FALSE otherwise).

description: |
  Sets the flag of an item as a droppable item or an undroppable item.
remarks: |
  Useful function. For instance, if you have a bunch of enemies with a certain item, and you only want some of them to drop that, but want it determined randomly, you can call SetDroppableFlag either OnSpawn or OnDeath of those creatures with a randomness factor determining if the item should be droppable or not.
version: 1.30
example: |
  //A bunch of creatures have items tagged "some_boots". You
  //want, statistically, 25% of them to drop those boots
  //when slain. Goes either OnDeath or OnSpawn
  void main()
  {
  object oItem=GetItemPossessedBy(OBJECT_SELF, "some_boots");
  //25% chance of being droppable
  int bDroppable=d100()>75;
  SetDroppableFlag(oItem, bDroppable);
  }
