type: Function
name: GetNearestSeenOrHeardEnemy
shortdesc: Determines closest visual creature and determines the closest heard creature.
return: object
parameters:
description: |
  Returns the nearest object that can be seen, then checks for the nearest heard target. 
  Later AI for HotU and SoU has this remark: Now just a wrapper around GetNearestPerceivedEnemy.
remarks: |
  Note: Because of later adjustments to the AI, this NEVER returns anything that is mearly heard! 
  This function should probably not be used as much to see if it matches the actual words of the function. 
  The older version, which mearly does what it says on the tin, is below in the code example.
requirements: |
  #include "NW_I0_GENERIC"
version: 1.62
example: |
  // Can put this in your script directly, or in a new include, if you
  // want the original functionality of it.
  // Returns the nearest object that can be seen, then checks for the nearest heard target.
  object GetNearestSeenOrHeardEnemy();
  // Returns the nearest object that can be seen, then checks for the nearest heard target.
  object GetNearestSeenOrHeardEnemy()
  {
      object oTarget = GetNearestCreature(CREATURE_TYPE_REPUTATION, REPUTATION_TYPE_ENEMY, OBJECT_SELF, 1, CREATURE_TYPE_PERCEPTION, PERCEPTION_SEEN);
      if(!GetIsObjectValid(oTarget))
      {
