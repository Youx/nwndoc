type: Function
name: TurnsToSeconds
shortdesc: Convert turns into seconds.
return: float
parameters:
  - type: int
    name: nTurns
    desc: | The number of turns to convert into seconds.

description: |
  Returns the value of nTurns converted into seconds. A single turn is always 60 seconds. 
  This value never changes due to the game clock - it is real time.
remarks: |
  Great way to apply a turn-based effect to an object when ApplyEffectToObject expects seconds instead of turns. Used mostly for spell effects in the game. 
  Note that a turn, in the P&P D&D books, is what we call a round (6 second) in NwN. Do not get confused if it says "2 turns", which means 12 seconds, not 120.
version: 1.62
example: |
  // Simple custom spell cast by an NPC.  The spell should last 1 turn per level of the caster.
  void main(){
      int nDurationOfSpell = GetCasterLevel(OBJECT_SELF);
      effect eBonusToApply = EffectAttackIncrease(1);
      object oTargetOfSpell = GetSpellTargetObject();
      ApplyEffectToObject(DURATION_TYPE_TEMPORARY, eBonusToApply, oTargetOfSpell, TurnsToSeconds(nDurationOfSpell));
  }
