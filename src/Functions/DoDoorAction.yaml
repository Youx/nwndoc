shortdesc: Does specific action to target door.
return: void
parameters:
  - type: object
    name: oTargetDoor

  - type: int
    name: nDoorAction
    desc: | DOOR_ACTION_*

description: |
  Perform nDoorAction on oTargetDoor.
remarks: |
  This is specifically for adding the action on top of an action queue. This means the OnBlocked event can fire and open a door without disrupting any ActionMoveToLocation commands. 
  Not all GetIsDoorActionPossible() checks are comprehensive, therefore DoDoorAction may fail even if the check is passed.
