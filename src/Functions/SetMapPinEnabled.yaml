description: |
  Enables or disables a map pin on the displayed map.
remarks: |
  A VERY useful function if you want to add some realism to your modules. Personally, I dislike knowing that "oh, so that's where the bad guy is because that's where the map pin is", even if I don't look at the map pin's caption. 
  Thus, this can for instance be used OnEnter of a trigger to make a PC get the panel button.
bugs: |
  Not a bug, but it is too bad that there is no "oPC" parameter to only enable the map pin for a single player instead of all players in a multiplayer environment.
