  // it to close and lock itself at dusk
  // and unlock itself at dawn
  void main()
  {
     if (GetIsDusk() && GetIsOpen (OBJECT_SELF))
     {
        ActionCloseDoor (OBJECT_SELF);
        // SetLocked is set in an ActionDoCommand because we
        // want it to be in the door's queue... we want the
        // ActionCloseDoor to be completed before locking the
        // door.
        ActionDoCommand (SetLocked (OBJECT_SELF, TRUE));
     }
     else if (GetIsDawn() && GetLocked (OBJECT_SELF))
