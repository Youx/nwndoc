name: aGetPLocalInt
shortdesc: Scans through the PC's party and returns the largest value stored on a character.
return: int
parameters:

    name: oPC
    desc: | A member of the PC party.

  - type: string
    name: sLocalName

description: |
  The purpose of this function is to encapsulate the GetLocalInt function so that it treats the entire party as a single entity. The value returned is the largest value stored on ANY of the PC's party that is availible via the GetLocalInt(object, string) method.
remarks: |
  This function is useful for getting plot flags that may be stored on any PC in a party of PCs. Found in nw_j_assassin.nss, and used to make plots more multi-player friendly. Same as aGetPLocalInt(object, string).
requirements: |
  #include "nw_j_assassin"
