    desc: | Being whose movement rate to return

description: |
  Gets the movement rate of a being, either a PC or an NPC. The possible return values are: 
  0 = PC Movement Speed or invalid oCreature 
  1 = Immobile 
  2 = Very Slow 
  3 = Slow 
  4 = Normal 
  5 = Fast 
  6 = Very Fast 
  7 = Creature Default (defined in appearance.2da) 
  8 = DM Speed 
remarks: |
  This cannot be used to determine if a PC (Or any other creature) is walking or running as a PC always returns a value of 0. 
  DM's should return 8, because that is thier movement speed (untested). 
  This value is basically that set in a creatures properties. The Creature Default can only be got by the value in appearance.2da, while the others are in creaturespeed.2da: 
  Name; Walkrate, Runrate (All in meters/round)

  Immobile: 0.00, 0.00 
  Very Slow: 0.75, 1.50

  Normal: 1.75, 3.50 
  Fast: 2.25, 4.50
