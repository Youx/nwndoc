  From the source code: 
  Henchmen can only be hired once, ever. 
  This checks or sets the local on the henchmen 
  that keeps track whether they've ever been hired.
remarks: |
  Found in: nw_i0_henchman.nss: 105 
  Basically, it just sets a local variable on the henchman, telling us that this henchman has been hired.
