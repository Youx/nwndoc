type: Function
name: ClearAllFactionMembers
shortdesc: Makes an NPC or group of NPCs feel Neutral towards the PC.
return: void
parameters:
  - type: object
    name: oMember
    desc: | oPlayer

  - type: object
    name: oPlayer
description: |
  Receives the oMember object, and adjusts all members of the oMembers faction group to friendly reputation towards the oPlayer. 
  To use this, copy it to your script, or use the code example for the function without having to find the original script.
remarks: |
  Note that this function is most useful to clear personal reputations at other times then just death - for example, making an entire guard faction for a town friendly, if the PC mistakenly pickpocketed one of them (which causes personal reputation to change). 
  If the global flag of a faction is off too, then using this will make sure all the NPC's in that faction react as the Adjusted Alignment makes them.

  // The original function in all its glory. It is here because it is

  void ClearAllFactionMembers(object oMember, object oPlayer)
  {
      AdjustReputation(oPlayer, oMember, 100);
      // * Player bad
      SetLocalInt(oPlayer, "NW_G_Playerhasbeenbad", 10);
      // Clear all faction members' reputations
      object oClear = GetFirstFactionMember(oMember, FALSE);
      while (GetIsObjectValid(oClear) == TRUE)
      {
          ClearPersonalReputation(oPlayer, oClear);
          oClear = GetNextFactionMember(oMember, FALSE);
