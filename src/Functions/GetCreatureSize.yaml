type: Function
name: GetCreatureSize
shortdesc: Determines the size class of a creature.
return: int
parameters:
  - type: object
    name: oCreature
    desc: | The creature whose size we are to determine.

description: |
  Returns the size (CREATURE_SIZE_*) of oCreature. 
  It returns CREATURE_SIZE_INVALID for an invlaid size - normally a non-creature. 
  The sizes are defined by the 2da file, creaturesize.2da
remarks: |
  This is determined by the appearance of the creature. 
  A PC who is polymorphed into a dragon will return the CREATURE_SIZE_HUGE, not thier normal CREATURE_SIZE_MEDIUM. 
  There is no way to change this appart from changing the appearance.2da file. 
  It also only really affects Knockdown and AC. - it is harder (more penalties) to attack a larger creature, and tiny creatures get a small bonus to AC (+2), small get some (+1), large get a small penalty (-1) and huge gets a small penatly (-2). The AC changes show up in a creatures properties in the toolset.

  {
      // Check our size
      if(GetCreatureSize(OBJECT_SELF) == CREATURE_SIZE_HUGE)
      {
          // Speak the taunt - Monty Python fans might remember 
          // this from a certain Archiologist Height scetch
          SpeakString("I'm so tall! Ahahhehehehe!");
