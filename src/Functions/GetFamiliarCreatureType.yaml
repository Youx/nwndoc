type: Function
name: GetFamiliarCreatureType
shortdesc: Gets the PC's animal companion creature type.
return: int
parameters:
  - type: object
    name: oCreature
    desc: | The PC who has an animal companion.

description: |
  Returns oCreature's animal companion creature type (ANIMAL_COMPANION_CREATURE_TYPE_*). 
  Returns ANIMAL_COMPANION_CREATURE_TYPE_NONE if oCreature is invalid or does not currently have an animal companion.
remarks: |
  Returns no information for summoned creatures. Note that an animal companion is different from a familiar. 
  This function returns the type of familiar that can be summoned, not the type of familiar that is currently summoned, so you can't use this to determine if a familiar has been summoned or not. 
  If oCreature is possessing the familiar when this function is called, it will return FAMILIAR_TYPE_NONE. Presumably this is because a possessed familiar can't summon a familiar.
bugs: |
  GetAnimalCompanion* and GetFamiliar* functions are reversed - GetAnimalCompanion* returns for Sorcerer and Wizard familiars and GetFamiliar* returns for Ranger and Druid animal companions.
