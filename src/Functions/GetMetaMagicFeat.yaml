type: Function
name: GetMetaMagicFeat
shortdesc: Get the type of metamagic used on the last spell.
return: int
parameters:
description: |
  Returns an integer corresponding to the METAMAGIC_* constant describing which metamagic was used on the last spell cast. This value should remain the same until another spell has been cast. The function will return a value of â€“1 if the caster is not a valid object.
remarks: |
  This is called from an object who cast a spell. Epic-level Automatic feats do not show up with this (As this can only return 1 value). It should also be noted you shouldn't use it anywhere but a spell script, because of unreliability.
version: 1.22
example: |
  // OnHeartbeat this will tell you if you have used metamagic.
  void main()
  {
      if(GetMetaMagicFeat() == METAMAGIC_ANY)
          SendMessageToPC(OBJECT_SELF,"YOU USED METAMAGIC ON LAST SPELL");
  }
