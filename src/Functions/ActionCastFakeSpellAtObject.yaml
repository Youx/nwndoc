type: Function
name: ActionCastFakeSpellAtObject
shortdesc: Display casting animation and spell visuals without subsequent spell effects.
return: void
parameters:
  - type: int
    name: nSpell
    desc: | SPELL_*

  - type: object
    name: oTarget
    desc: | The target object for the animation to be fake-cast at

  - type: int
    name: nProjectilePathType
    default: PROJECTILE_PATH_TYPE_DEFAULT
    desc: | PROJECTILE_* (Default: PROJECTILE_PATH_TYPE_DEFAULT)

description: |
  The Action recipient will have the appearance of casting nSpell, but there will no corresponding game effects as a result. The spell effect will be centered on or aimed at oTarget. 
  SPECULATION: if oTarget is invalid the Action will fail.
remarks: |
  It will have the same projectile visual effects (Such as Phantasmal Killer's illisionary beast that leaps from the caster to the target), and casting visuals, as the spells.2da entry, but not fire the spell script, and the caster doesn't need to know the spell. 
  Also note that ActionCastFakeSpell still incurs Attacks-of-oppotunity in combat, for some reason.
bugs: |
  For some reason stacking this Action doesn't seem to produce a predictable string of castings. The creature will cast the first FakeSpell and when reaching the next FakeSpell in its Action Queue will halt all following queued Actions.
version: 1.61
example: |
  //Function made by Lilac Soul to illustrate the use of
  //ActionCastFakeSpellAtObject - in this function, I use it
  //to have the NPC speaker "cast a spell" at the PC which
  //sets him or her at 1 experience point...
  void main()
  {
  object oPC=GetPCSpeaker();
  //Wave my hands and talk like I'm casting the
  //wail of the banshee spell
  ActionCastFakeSpellAtObject(SPELL_WAIL_OF_THE_BANSHEE, oPC);
  //Apply a couple of visual effects to the PC
  int nDur=DURATION_TYPE_INSTANT;
  effect e1=EffectVisualEffect(VFX_FNF_HOWL_MIND);
  effect e2=EffectVisualEffect(VFX_FNF_PWKILL);
  ActionDoCommand(ApplyEffectToObject(nDur, e2, oPC));
  DelayCommand(4.5, ApplyEffectToObject(nDur, e1, oPC));
  //Set the PC to 1 XP - he won't be too happy with this spell!
  DelayCommand(4.5, SetXP(oPC, 1));
