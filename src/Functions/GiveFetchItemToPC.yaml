type: Function
name: GiveFetchItemToPC
shortdesc: Gives the fetch item to the PC.
return: void
parameters:
  - type: object
    name: oPC
    desc: | The PC to get the item.

description: |
  If oPC doesnâ€™t have the current fetch item, it is created on him / her.
remarks: |
  Found in nw_j_fetch.nss on line 220 
  The current fetch item is stored in a local variable, and then checked for by this function. 
  The item is given to oPC using ActionGiveItem, so this function should probably only be called by someone who possesses that item, and is capable of having an action queue. 
requirements: |
  #include "nw_j_fetch"
