type: Function
name: ItemPropertyImmunityMisc
shortdesc: Sets an immunity itemproperty.
return: itemproperty
parameters:
  - type: int
    name: nImmunityType
    desc: | IP_CONST_IMMUNITYMISC_*

description: |
  Sets item property Immunity to miscellaneous effects. You must specify the effect constant to which the user is immune, (IP_CONST_IMMUNITYMISC_*), such as Backstab or Fear.
remarks: |
  The itemproperty commands are special constructors - they construct an itemproperty "object" which can then be applied to an item using the AddItemProperty command, much like effects need to be first constructed, then applied with ApplyEffectToObject. 
  It will often be a good idea to remove similar itemproperties from the item first. There's a command in the "x2_inc_itemprop" include file called IPSafeAddItemProperty which will do that for you. Check IPSafeAddItemProperty for current bug report. 
  The IP_CONST_IMMUNITYMISC_* value can be retrieved off this type of item property using GetItemPropertySubType.
version: 1.61
example: |
  #include "x2_inc_itemprop"
  //The include is for the IPSafeAddItemProperty function
  //Makes the first PC speaker's helmet give immunity to mind-affecting spells
  void main()
  {
  object oPC=GetFirstPC();
  object oItem = GetItemInSlot(INVENTORY_SLOT_HEAD, oPC);
  if (!GetIsObjectValid(oItem)) return;
  itemproperty ipAdd = ItemPropertyImmunityMisc(IP_CONST_IMMUNITYMISC_MINDSPELLS);
  IPSafeAddItemProperty(oItem, ipAdd);
  }
