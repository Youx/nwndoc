description: |
  Returns an itemproperty.
remarks: |
  This is a wrapper function for creating an itemproperty based off of an ITEM_PROPERTY_* parameter. For each different value of the nPropID parameter, it calls the appropriate ItemProperty function with as many parameters as that function requires. Thus, if you pass ITEM_PROPERTY_TRUE_SEEING, you don't need to pass anything for either of the nParam parameters. If you pass, for instance, ITEM_PROPERTY_ABILITY_BONUS, you'll need both nParam1 and nParam2. It is recommended that you look under the individual ItemProperty functions for more information on which types of itemproperties require which types of parameters.
bugs: |
  According to BioWare, the following is not a bug, but it is still something to be aware of: 
  This function is quite incomplete. I ran a test, and about half of the valid ITEM_PROPERTY_* constants did either not return a valid itemproperty, or returned an itemproperty of the incorrect type. 
  I recommend against using this function, unless you are absolutely certain that all the inputs you give it will produce the desired output.
