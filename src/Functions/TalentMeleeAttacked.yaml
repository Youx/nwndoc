type: Function
name: TalentMeleeAttacked
shortdesc: Determines best course of action for NPC spell-caster when in melee combat.
return: int
parameters:
  - type: object
    name: oIntruder
    default: OBJECT_INVALID
    desc: | (Default: OBJECT_INVALID)

description: |
  Function runs through list of TOUCH, RANGED and AREA EFFECT talents that OBJECT_SELF may have, tried to determine the best one, failing that, determines a random talent attack of the above type. 
  IF OBJECT_SELF currently in combat with more than 1 foe, checks AREA EFFECT, TOUCH and RANGED talents (in that order.) with same checks for validity.
remarks: |
  This function has been moved to x0_i0_talent, but it is still sufficient to include nw_i0_generic. 
  ISSUE 1: The check in this function to use a random ability after failing to use best will fail in the following case. 
  The creature is unable to affect the target with the spell and has only 1 spell of that type. 
  This can be eliminated with a check in the else to the effect of : else if(!CompareLastSpellCast(GetIdFromTalent(tUse))) 
  This check was not put in in version 1.0 due to time constraints. 
  ISSUE 2: Given the Spell Attack is the drop out check the else statements in this talent should be cut.
