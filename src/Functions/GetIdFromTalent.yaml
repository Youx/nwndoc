type: Function
name: GetIdFromTalent
shortdesc: Determines the identifier of a talent.
return: int
parameters:
  - type: talent
    name: tTalent
    desc: | The talent to get the ID of.

description: |
  Returns the identifier of tTalent from SPELL_*, FEAT_* or SKILL_*.
remarks: |
  When writing generic AI for creatures there are functions, like GetCreatureTalentBest, that return talents that can be used in a situation but a lot of functions require the identifiers to be used. This converts from 'talent' to those identifiers. 
  You probably want to use this function in conjunction with GetTypeFromTalent, because a lot of the SPELL_*, FEAT_*, and SKILL_* constants correspond to the same value. Thus, this would be TRUE even for FEAT_ALERTNESS and SKILL_ANIMAL_EMPATHY, because they're all just the integer value 0:
