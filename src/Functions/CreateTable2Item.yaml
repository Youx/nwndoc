remarks: |
  Found in: nw_o2_coninclude.nss: 4008 
remarks: |
  Then, depending on the class found, probabilities for each type of item is determined, and compared with a d100 roll to create the item. The actual item creation takes place by calling other functions in nw_i0_coninclude. 
  This can be used to create the item in any object with an inventory.
requirements: |
