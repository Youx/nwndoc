type: Function
name: ItemPropertyWeightReduction
shortdesc: Sets a weight reduction itemproperty.
return: itemproperty
parameters:
  - type: int
    name: nReduction
    desc: | IP_CONST_REDUCEDWEIGHT_*

description: |
  Sets item property Weight reduction. You need to specify the weight reduction constant (IP_CONST_REDUCEDWEIGHT_*).
remarks: |
  The itemproperty commands are special constructors - they construct an itemproperty "object" which can then be applied to an item using the AddItemProperty command, much like effects need to be first constructed, then applied with ApplyEffectToObject. 
  It will often be a good idea to remove similar itemproperties from the item first. There's a command in the "x2_inc_itemprop" include file called IPSafeAddItemProperty which will do that for you. Check IPSafeAddItemProperty for current bug report. 
  The IP_CONST_REDUCEDWEIGHT_* value can be retrieved off this type of item property using GetItemPropertyCostTableValue.
version: 1.61
example: |
  #include "x2_inc_itemprop"
  //The include is for the IPSafeAddItemProperty function
  //Makes the PC speaker's armor very light
  void main()
  {
  object oPC=GetPCSpeaker();
  object oItem = GetItemInSlot(INVENTORY_SLOT_CHEST, oPC);
  if (!GetIsObjectValid(oItem)) return;
  itemproperty ipAdd = ItemPropertyWeightReduction(IP_CONST_REDUCEDWEIGHT_80_PERCENT);
  IPSafeAddItemProperty(oItem, ipAdd);
  }
