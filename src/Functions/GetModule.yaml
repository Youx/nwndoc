description: |
  Returns the module object. On error will return OBJECT_INVALID. Used with GetLocal* and SetLocal* functions for creating global (module-level) variables.
remarks: |
  If there is a return of OBJECT_INVALID then that would mean that the game has crashed wouldn't it? I haven't been able to test this.
version: 1.22
example: |
  // sends the tag of the module to the first PC
  void main()
  {
      SendMessageToPC(GetFirstPC(),GetTag(GetModule()));
  }
