    name: bDisplayFeedback

description: |
  The caller will perform a melee touch attack on oTarget. This is not an action, and it assumes the caller is already within range of oTarget. 
  Returns 0 on a miss, 1 on a hit, and 2 on a critical hit.
remarks: |
  No combat animations are performed, and no damage is dealt. It simply does a roll to see if the target is hit, and if bDisplayFeedback is TRUE, displays feedback in the combat feedback window.
