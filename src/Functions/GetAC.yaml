type: Function
name: GetAC
shortdesc: Retrieves the AC (armor class) of a creature.
return: int
parameters:
  - type: object
    name: oObject
    desc: | The object to get the AC of.

  - type: int
    name: nForFutureUse
    default: 0
    desc: | Parameter reserved for future use and currently does nothing. (Default: 0)

description: |
  Returns the AC (armor class) of oObject if it is a creature. 
  Returns 0 if oObject is an item, door, or placeable. 
  Returns -1 if oObject is not a creature, item, door, or placeable. 
  nForFutureUse is not in use, and should not be changed.
remarks: |
  This shouldn't get any AC-versus bonuses - EG: Protection Against Evil grants +2 deflection AC against evil-only people, or AC verus a specific damage type. 
  It will, in reality, return the exact AC value on the character sheet - this does not include versus-bonuses, and is the "AC versus all" of the character. 
  Doors, Placeables can be attacked, and do actually have an AC of 0, because only a critical miss (Getting a 1 on a d20) will miss it.
version: 1.28
example: |
  // this script can simulate an attack triggered when a door or 
  // placeable is opened.  
  // this script rolls a d20 and checks the results against the 
  // person's AC; if the die roll is at least the AC of the target it 
  // does d10 damage (kind of a very unfair trap that can't be
  // searched for or disabled).
  main()
  {
     object oPC = GetLastOpenedBy();
     int nDieRoll = d20();
     if (nDieRoll >= GetAC(oPC)) {
        effect eDamage = EffectDamage(d10(), DAMAGE_TYPE_PIERCING);
        ApplyEffectToObject(DURATION_TYPE_INSTANT, eDamage, oPC);
     }
  }
