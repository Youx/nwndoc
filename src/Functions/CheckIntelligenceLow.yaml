type: Function
name: CheckIntelligenceLow
shortdesc: Determines if the Intelligence score of the speaking player is below 9.
return: int
parameters:
description: |
  Returns TRUE if the player character in the conversation has an intelligence lower than 9.
remarks: |
  This function always uses GetPCSpeaker() to determine the intelligence score, so using it anywhere besides in a conversation will return FALSE. This was used by BioWare to handle different conversation choices and provide small insults for those characters who were of low intelligence.

  //Add as a starting conditional on a conversation thread for a Quest giving NPC who expects the player to return a stolen item.

  	if(GetLocalInt(GetPCSpeaker(), "STEAL_DIAMOND_QUEST") == 1){
