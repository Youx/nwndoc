type: Function
name: ItemPropertyHaste
shortdesc: Sets a haste itemproperty.
return: itemproperty
parameters:
description: |
  Sets item property Haste, which can be applied to an item to make a player Hasted.
remarks: |
  The itemproperty commands are special constructors - they construct an itemproperty "object" which can then be applied to an item using the AddItemProperty command, much like effects need to be first constructed, then applied with ApplyEffectToObject. 
  It will often be a good idea to remove similar itemproperties from the item first. There's a command in the "x2_inc_itemprop" include file called IPSafeAddItemProperty which will do that for you. Check IPSafeAddItemProperty for current bug report.
version: 1.61
example: |
  #include "x2_inc_itemprop"
  //The include is for the IPSafeAddItemProperty function
  //Makes the PC speaker's boots hasted
  void main()
  {
  object oPC=GetPCSpeaker();
  object oItem = GetItemInSlot(INVENTORY_SLOT_BOOTS, oPC);
  if (!GetIsObjectValid(oItem)) return;
  itemproperty ipAdd = ItemPropertyHaste();
  IPSafeAddItemProperty(oItem, ipAdd);
  }
