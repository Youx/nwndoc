type: Function
name: CheckWayPoints
shortdesc: Checks to see if an NPC has a valid waypoint to walk to.
return: int
parameters:
  - type: object
    name: oWalker
    default: OBJECT_SELF
    desc: | The creature to check for valid waypoints. (Default: OBJECT_SELF)

description: |
  This function takes oWalker's tag, and looks for waypoint tags with matching names: "POST_<tag>" and "WP_<tag>_01" (always checked). If the NW_FLAG_DAY_NIGHT_POSTING spawn-in condition has been set in oWalker's OnSpawn script, then "NIGHT_<tag>" and "WN_<tag>" are also sought. 
  If ANY of these new tags is the tag of a valid waypoint the function returns true.
remarks: |
  CheckWayPoints could be useful as a sanity check on NPCs with waypoints. 
  This is used by SetListeningPatterns() in nw_i0_generic to do prevent NPCs with waypoints to walk from going to sleep at night (unimplemented).
requirements: |
  #include "nw_i0_generic"
version: 1.22
example: |
  // Source for CheckWayPoints():
  int CheckWayPoints(object oWalker = OBJECT_SELF)
  {
      object oWay1;
      object oWay2;
      object oWay3;
      object oWay4;
      string sTag = GetTag(oWalker);
      if(GetSpawnInCondition(NW_FLAG_DAY_NIGHT_POSTING))
      {
          oWay2 = GetWaypointByTag("NIGHT_" + sTag);
          oWay4 = GetWaypointByTag("WN_" + sTag + "_01");
      }
      oWay1 = GetWaypointByTag("POST_" + sTag);
      oWay3 = GetWaypointByTag("WP_" + sTag + "_01");
      if(GetIsObjectValid(oWay2) || GetIsObjectValid(oWay4) || GetIsObjectValid(oWay1) || GetIsObjectValid(oWay3))
      {
          return TRUE;
      }
      return FALSE;
  }
