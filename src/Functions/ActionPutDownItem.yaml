bugs: |
  ActionPutDownItem captures the location to drop the item at as soon as the command is added to the action queue meaning if you tell a npc to move from point A to point B and then drop an item it will move to point B and then run (or sometimes "slide") back to point A and drop the item there. 
  This is only a problem if you want the NPC to move before dropping something; workarounds include using DelayCommand() or create some clunky system where you put the ActionPutDownItem() part in a seperate script and execute it using ActionDoCommand().
