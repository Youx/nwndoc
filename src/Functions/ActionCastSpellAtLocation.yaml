description: |
  Use this function to cast a spell at a specific location. You must at least give this function a Spell (nSpell) and a Location (lTargetLocation) for it to work properly. 
  The location can be a Waypoint or anything else you can set in the GetLocation function. 
  Set bCheat to true if you wish the executor of the script to be able to cast the spell whether or not they have the ability to cast.
remarks: |
  Use this function when you wish to cast a spell at a particular location. The object calling this function will become the origin of the casting. For example a fireball trap that triggers over a chest. Note that spells cast with this function will actually apply their damage and/or effects; for visuals only, see ActionCastFakeSpellAtLocation.
bugs: |
  For some reason, any memorised spells which are prepared metamagically (A Empowered Fireball for example) cause this to not work correctly. Cheat-cast, or non-metamagically prepared spells work correctly, however, as do if they are passed into ActionCastSpellAtObject. 
  1.64 does fix the problem with sub-dial spells. These can now be cast correctly using these functions. It doesn't mention any fixes for the above issues however.
  1.68 does fix the problem with Ranger and Paladin spells not working properly. (nMetaMagic was ignored in the spell script)
version: 1.68
example: |
  // The script below is placed on the OnUse Event handler for a placeable, in our
  // example a lever. When used it casts a Fireball spell at the target. In this case
  // the target is a Waypoint with the tag "TARGET_WP1".
  void main()
  {
      location lTarget = GetLocation(GetWaypointByTag("TARGET_WP1"));
      ActionCastSpellAtLocation(SPELL_FIREBALL,lTarget,METAMAGIC_NONE,1,PROJECTILE_PATH_TYPE_HIGH_BALLISTIC,1);
  }
