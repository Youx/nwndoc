name: GetLevelByPosition
shortdesc: Get the class level of an object from the class table.
return: int
parameters:
  - type: int
    name: nClassPosition
    desc: | The row in the class table to get a value from. Range is 1 to 3.

  - type: object
    name: oCreature
    default: OBJECT_SELF
    desc: | The object to get a value from. (Default: OBJECT_SELF)

description: |
  Returns an integer that describes the class level of oCreature in position nClassPosition of the class table (i.e., returns the level of oCreature's [nClassPosition]th class). If oCreature doesn't have a class table (e.g., a placeable object or trigger), or if the object doesn't have a class in the targeted position (e.g. the second position for a single-classed character) then the function will return 0 as there is no class value to return.

  // Return the level of the player's first class
  void main()
  {
      int i;
      i = GetLevelByPosition(1,GetFirstPC());
      SendMessageToPC(GetFirstPC(),"Your first class is level == " + IntToString(i));
  }
