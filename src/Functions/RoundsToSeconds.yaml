type: Function
name: RoundsToSeconds
shortdesc: Converts a number of rounds into seconds.
return: float
parameters:
  - type: int
    name: nRounds
    desc: | The number of rounds to convert into seconds.

description: |
  Returns the value of nRounds converted into seconds. A single round is 6.0 seconds.
remarks: |
  In P&P D&D, a round doesn't actually exsist. They declare them as turns, and so don't get confused by there being rounds in NwN.
version: 1.22
example: |
  // We wait 2 rounds until we apply damage from some poison. 
  // Uses the first PC in the module
  void main()
  {
      // Get who to damage
      object oTarget = GetFirstPC();
      // Declare magical damage
      effect eDam = EffectDamage(5);
      // Get delay - should be 12.0 seconds.
      float fDelay = RoundsToSeconds(2);
      // Delay the damage
      // * Note: Putting EffectDamage directly into the function here would result in an invalid DelayCommand().
      DelayCommand(fDelay, ApplyEffectToObject(DURATION_TYPE_INSTANT, eDam, oTarget));
