description: |
  Changes the current Day/Night cycle for this player to daylight.
remarks: |
  If called while it is day, the player might see the screen go dark for a short while and then fade back in. This doesn't look so good, so it may be a good idea to use this together with the GetIsDay / GetIsNight functions. 
  This doesn't cause the game time to change at all.
