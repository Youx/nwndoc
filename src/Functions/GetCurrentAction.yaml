parameters:
  - type: object
    name: oObject

description: |
  Get the current action (ACTION_*) that oObject is executing from its Action Queue. oObject can be anything with an action queue. Modules and Areas cannot have actions assigned to them.
remarks: |
  As of 1.60, Defensive stance and Random Walk can be returned by new constants. Some actions still return ACTION_INVALID, however. 
  Use GetActionMode() to check if a creature is using parry, power attack and so on.

example: |
  // On Phsical Attacked event, if we are currently moving, stop.
  // Could use to stop a moving archery target in an archery range.
  void main()
  {
      if(GetUserDefinedEventNumber() == 1005)
      {
          // Check action - ACTION_MOVETOPOINT
          if(GetCurrentAction() == ACTION_MOVETOPOINT)
          {
              // Stop moving
              ClearAllActions();
              // Could do other stuff
          }
