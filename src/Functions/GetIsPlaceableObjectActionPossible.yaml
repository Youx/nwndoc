type: Function
name: GetIsPlaceableObjectActionPossible
shortdesc: Check whether a given action is valid for a given placeable object.
return: int
parameters:
  - type: object
    name: oPlaceable
    desc: | Placeable object.

  - type: int
    name: nPlaceableAction
    desc: | PLACEABLE_ACTION_*

description: |
  Returns TRUE if the owner of the script can perform the action specified in the second argument on the placeable object given in the first argument. Otherwise, returns FALSE.
remarks: |
  This function only works if it is placed in a script which is "owned" by the creature which will be performing the action. Otherwise, it will always return FALSE. This is necessary because it takes the abilities of the creature into account when determining whether the action is possible.
