type: Function
name: GetLastClosedBy
shortdesc: Determine which creature closed a door or placeable.
return: object
parameters:
description: |
  Use this in an OnClose script to get the object that last closed the door or placeable. Returns the creature that last closed the door or placeable. Returns OBJECT_INVALID if the caller is not a valid door or placeable.
remarks: |
  This function should only be called from the OnClose event script of a door or placeable object. Otherwise it will always return OBJECT_INVALID. 
  But, as of 1.62, the GetLastClosedBy() scripting command now works in the OnStoreClosed event of stores.
