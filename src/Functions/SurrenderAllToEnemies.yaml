description: |
  Cause all members of the faction of the given surrendering character (oSurrendering) to issue a SurrenderToEnemies call. 
  That means all NPC's in a 10 metre radius stop what they are doing, and enemies become neutral for 3 minutes. 
  Only works if the faction member is in the same area as oSurrendering and is not a PC
remarks: |
  Does not work on PCs, but DOES work on their associates. 
  Also note that x0_i0_partywide is already included in x0_i0_common. So you will only need to include one, not both.
requirements: |
  #include "x0_i0_partywide"
