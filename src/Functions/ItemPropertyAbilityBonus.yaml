shortdesc: Sets an ability bonus itemproperty.
return: itemproperty
parameters:
  - type: int

    desc: | IP_CONST_ABILITY_* test

  - type: int
    name: nBonus
    desc: | Ability bonus to add; 1 to 12 are valid values.

description: |
  Sets item property Ability bonus, for abilities such as Charisma. You need to specify an ability constant (IP_CONST_ABILITY_*) and the bonus, which should be a positive integer between 1 and 12.
remarks: |
  The itemproperty commands are special constructors - they construct an itemproperty "object" which can then be applied to an item using the AddItemProperty command, much like effects need to be first constructed, then applied with ApplyEffectToObject. 
  It will often be a good idea to remove similar itemproperties from the item first. There's a command in the "x2_inc_itemprop" include file called IPSafeAddItemProperty which will do that for you. Check IPSafeAddItemProperty for current bug report. 
  The IP_CONST_ABILITY_* constant can be retrieved off ability bonus itemproperties using GetItemPropertySubType. The bonus can be retrieved using GetItemPropertyCostTableValue.
version: 1.61
example: |
  #include "x2_inc_itemprop"
  //The include is for the IPSafeAddItemProperty function
  //Makes the PC speaker's belt a belt of +10 strength!
  void main()
  {
  object oPC=GetPCSpeaker();
  object oBelt=GetItemInSlot(INVENTORY_SLOT_BELT, oPC);
  if (!GetIsObjectValid(oBelt)) return;
  itemproperty ipAddStrength=ItemPropertyAbilityBonus(IP_CONST_ABILITY_STR, 10);
  IPSafeAddItemProperty(oBelt, ipAddStrength);
  }
