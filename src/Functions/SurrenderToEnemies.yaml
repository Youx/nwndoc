description: |
  Use this on an NPC to cause all creatures within a 10-metre radius to stop what they are doing and sets the NPC's enemies within this range to be neutral towards the NPC for roughly 3 minutes. If this command is run on a PCor an object that is not a creature, nothing will happen.
remarks: |
  Very useful function. Can for instance be used to make an enemy surrender just before dying, to try and cut a deal with his attackers...
bugs: |
  Previous bug about wounding fixed in 1.62, the function does remove wounding effects from creatures so you can talk to them.
version: 1.61
example: |
  //Cause an NPC to attack a player and then surrender so the player does not auto attack back at them.
  void main()
  {
       object oPC = GetNearestCreature(CREATURE_TYPE_PLAYER_CHAR, PLAYER_CHAR_IS_PC);
       DelayCommand(2.0, SurrenderToEnemies()); 
       ActionAttack(oPC, TRUE);
  }
