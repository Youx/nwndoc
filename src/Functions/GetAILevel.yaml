type: Function
name: GetAILevel
shortdesc: Retrieves the current AI (artificial intelligence) level that a creature is running at.
return: int
parameters:
  - type: object
    name: oTarget
    default: OBJECT_SELF
    desc: | Creature to check the AI level of. (Default: OBJECT_SELF)

description: |
  Returns the current AI_LEVEL_* value that a creature is running at. Different AI levels indicate how smart a creature acts and how much CPU time and priority it receives. Creatures that are standing by doing nothing generally have AI_LEVEL_LOW, but when a creature enters combat it will have AI_LEVEL_NORMAL by default.
remarks: |
  Too many creatures with AI_LEVEL_NORMAL will tax the processor and performance degradation will occur. 
  AI_LEVEL_DEFAULT is recommended. Also note that the "smartness" is not actual "The AI will decide to do a worse action" but, "The AI doesn't have as much time from the CPU, and may have delayed actions".
version: 1.30
example: |
  // If the AI level is not AI_LEVEL_DEFAULT, set it to it!
  void main()
  {
      if(GetAILevel() != AI_LEVEL_DEFAULT)
      {
          SetAILevel(OBJECT_SELF, AI_LEVEL_DEFAULT);
      }
  }
