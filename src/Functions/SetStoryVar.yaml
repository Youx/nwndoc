description: |
  This tracks the status of the specific story a henchman may have through the PC's movement through the storyline of the module. 
  It puts the current status of the Henchman story in a local variable that starts with (NW_L_HENSTORYC) and is appended by the current chapter of the game.
remarks: |
  Script: nw_i0_henchman.nss: Line: 152 
  This is part of Biowareâ€™s own quest and reward system. It is hardly useful for anyone not copying that system to the very last detail.
