description: |
  Randomly chooses between two battlecries, 50/50.
remarks: |
  Found in nw_i0_spells.nss on line 39 
  Though the description to the battlecry states that the battlecry is based on the dragon’s age, this is not the case – a d100 is rolled, and which battlecry to play is based solely on that roll.
