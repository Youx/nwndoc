type: Function
name: ItemPropertyAttackPenalty
shortdesc: Sets an attack penalty itemproperty.
return: itemproperty
parameters:
  - type: int
    name: nPenalty
    desc: | Attack penalty; 1 to 5 are valid.

description: |
  Sets item property Attack penalty, which reduces the effectiveness of the attack. You must specify the attack penalty. The penalty should be a POSITIVE integer between 1 and 5 (nPenalty of 1 = -1 applied).
remarks: |
  The itemproperty commands are special constructors - they construct an itemproperty "object" which can then be applied to an item using the AddItemProperty command, much like effects need to be first constructed, then applied with ApplyEffectToObject. 
  It will often be a good idea to remove similar itemproperties from the item first. There's a command in the "x2_inc_itemprop" include file called IPSafeAddItemProperty which will do that for you. Check IPSafeAddItemProperty for current bug report. 
  The penalty can be retrieved off this type of item property using GetItemPropertyCostTableValue.
version: 1.61
example: |
  #include "x2_inc_itemprop"
  //The include is for the IPSafeAddItemProperty function
  //Gives the PC speaker's onhand weapon an attack penalty of 5
  void main()
  {
  object oPC = GetPCSpeaker();
  object oItem = GetItemInSlot(INVENTORY_SLOT_RIGHTHAND, oPC);
  if (!GetIsObjectValid(oItem)) return;
  itemproperty ipAdd = ItemPropertyAttackPenalty(5);
  IPSafeAddItemProperty(oItem, ipAdd);
  }
