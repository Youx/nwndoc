type: Function
name: ActionOpenDoor
shortdesc: An action that will cause a creature to open a door.
return: void
parameters:
  - type: object
    name: oDoor
    desc: | The door that will be opened.

description: |
  Cause the action subject to open oDoor. 
  If the subject of an ActionOpenDoor is the door, through AssignCommand or in a door's script, then the door will open itself. 
  However, if ActionOpenDoor is used in the script of a creature, that action will cause the creature to move to the door and open it as long as it is not locked.
remarks: |
  DoDoorAction(oDoor, DOOR_ACTION_OPEN) can be used as an alternative to add the action on top of any actions currently running, and is recommended for a creatures OnBlocked event.
bugs: |
  The toolset bug that made it impossible to create doors initially open does no longer exist, and thus thereâ€™s no need for the ActionOpenDoor workaround noted here previously.
version: 1.30
example: |
  // This script is for the OnEnter event for an area.
  // The script will command a door tagged "OPEN_DOOR"
  // to open itself.
  void main
  {
       // Initialize objects.
       object oDoor = GetObjectByTag("OPEN_DOOR");
       // Tell door to open itself.
       AssignCommand(oDoor, ActionOpenDoor(oDoor));
  }
