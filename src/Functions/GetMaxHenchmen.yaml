description: |
  Gets the maximum number of henchmen
remarks: |
  Since Hordes of the Underdark, it has been possible for a PC to have more than one henchman. By default, the max number of henchmen will still be 1 - which is what this function will return if the function SetMaxHenchmen hasn't been called first.
version: 1.61
example: |
  //Returns the number of henchmen oPC has employed
  //Returns -1 if oPC isn't a valid PC
  int GetNumHenchmen(object oPC)
  {
  if (!GetIsPC(oPC)) return -1;
  int nLoop, nCount;
  for (nLoop=1; nLoop<=GetMaxHenchmen(); nLoop++)
     {
     if (GetIsObjectValid(GetHenchman(oPC, nLoop)))
        nCount++;
     }
  return nCount;
  }
