type: Function
name: PersistentConversationAttempt
shortdesc: This function attempts to ensure that an NPC starts a conversation with a specified PC.
return: void
parameters:
  - type: object
    name: oPC
    desc: | The PC to start talking to.

  - type: string
    name: sConvo
    default: ""
    desc: | The resource reference (filename) of a conversation. (Default: "")

  - type: action
    name: bPrivate
    default: FALSE
    desc: | Specify whether the conversation is audible to everyone or only to the PC. (Default: FALSE)

description: |
  This function attempts to start a conversation between the NPC this function is being called by and the specified PC (oPC) using the conversation file (sConvo) supplied. 
  If sConvo is left blank then the NPC's normal conversation file will be used instead. 
  if bPrivate is set to TRUE, then the conversation text will only be seen by the relevant player.
remarks: |
  Each of the four attempts is seperated by a 3 second gap.
bugs: |
  This function does not work as expected. 
  It will always make four attempts to start the conversation, even if the first one succeeds, each successive attempt ending / cancelling the previous one.
requirements: |
  #include "x0_i0_common"
version: 1.61
example: |
  //This code taken from a script in the OnUsed event of a lever
  void main()
  {
      //Get the PC who used the lever
      object oPC = GetLastUsedBy();
      //Get the NPC who will start the conversation
      object oNPC = GetObjectByTag("NW_BOY");
      //Start the conversation between the NPC and the PC
      AssignCommand(oNPC,PersistentConversationAttempt(oPC));
  }
