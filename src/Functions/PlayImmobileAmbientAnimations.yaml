return: void
parameters:
description: |
  Assigns animation effects to the creature that called this function while keeping that creature at the spot where they are standing. This is used to produce more realistic creatures since they aren't just standing there like statues. 
remarks: |
  This function is part of the core AI system, and will be automatically called if the creatures OnSpawn script sets the spawn condition for immobile ambient animations. Meaning: 
  SetSpawnInCondition (NW_FLAG_IMMOBILE_AMBIENT_ANIMATIONS); 
  To assign a creature ambient animations that allow it to move around use: 
  SetSpawnInCondition(NW_FLAG_AMBIENT_ANIMATIONS); 
  This function is found in x0_i0_anims, but including nw_i0_generic will suffice.
requirements: |
  #include "nw_i0_generic"
