type: Function
name: PlaySound
shortdesc: Plays a sound on the client machine.
return: void
parameters:
  - type: string
    name: sSoundName
    desc: | The name of the sound to play.

description: |
  Play the wave resource named sSoundName.
remarks: |
  PlaySound returns immediately, it does not wait for the sound to finish playing. If you want to play a sound using a trigger, then look at the SoundObjectPlay function, as PlaySound requires an object to work.
bugs: |
  This might not be an actual bug, but though PlaySound isn't an action (you don't get the little yellow square on the screen), if you assign a PlaySound to someone, it will wait for their current action queue to finish before playing.
version: 1.61
example: |
  // Placed in the OnUsed event of the an object, for example a gong. The following script will cause a gong ring to sound.
  main()
  {
      PlaySound("as_cv_gongring2");
  }
