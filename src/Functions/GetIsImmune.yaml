type: Function
name: GetIsImmune
shortdesc: Determines whether a creature has a specific immunity.
return: int
parameters:
  - type: object
    name: oCreature
    desc: | The creature to check immunity for.

  - type: int
    name: nImmunityType
    desc: | IMMUNITY_TYPE_*

  - type: object
    name: oVersus
    default: OBJECT_INVALID
    desc: | If this is specified, then we also check for the race and alignment of oVersus. (Default: OBJECT_INVALID)

description: |
  Returns TRUE if oCreature has immunity of type nImmunity versus oVersus, otherwise FALSE. 
  oVersus should only change what is returned if an effect is applied with EffectVersusAlignment(), such as Protection from Evil, or EffectVersusRacialType().
remarks: |
  From version 1.62+, this correctly checks feats (such as a Paladins fear immunity) as well as item/spell immunities.
version: 1.22
