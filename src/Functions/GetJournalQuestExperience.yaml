type: Function
name: GetJournalQuestExperience
shortdesc: Returns the amount of experience set for a journal category.
return: int
parameters:
  - type: string
    name: szPlotID
    desc: | Journal category tag.

description: |
  Use this command to award experience for a journalled quest. It returns the amount of experience entered in to the category's 'xp' field in the journal editor. 
  You can set an xp value for a journalled quest in the journal editor, but AddJournalQuestEntry() does not set award this xp on completion. Use GetJournalQuestExperience() instead. 
  This will, of course, return a default of 0 if no journal quest is found, or there is a value of 0 for that quest.
remarks: |
  If you want to assign party experience, you might want to use RewardPartyXP() from Bioware's nw_i0_tool include. 
  Before scripting experience yourself, you might want to make sure that you can't use the conversation editor's script wizards to do the dirty work for you.
version: 1.62
example: |
  // Award a single PC, oPC, the full experience value of 
  // a quest with Journal Category Tag "isk_jrnl_bbbbk"
  GiveXPToCreature(oPC, GetJournalQuestExperience("isk_jrnl_bbbbk"));
  // A quest requires the PC to gather objects, and stores a
  // count of the objects obtained.  This calculates how much
  // to award the PC, proportional to the maximum 
  // (NUM_HORSESHOES)
  int iFound = GetLocalInt(oPC, "iFound");
  int iXP = iFound  * GetJournalQuestExperience("shoe_hunt") / NUM_HORSESHOES;
