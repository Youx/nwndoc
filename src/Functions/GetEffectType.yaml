type: Function
name: GetEffectType
shortdesc: Get the type constant of the effect.
return: int
parameters:
  - type: effect
    name: eEffect
    desc: | The effect to compare or examine.

description: |
  Returns the effect type (EFFECT_TYPE_*) of the effect being examined. 
  Return EFFECT_INVALIDEFFECT if effect is invalid.
remarks: |
  You must first create and place the effect you wish to examine into a variable before calling this function. Useful when you need to check if a player is under the effects of a certain type before doing something else to them with your scripts. A good example would be checking for protection from evil effects before allowing an evil creature to close to them. 
  EDIT FROM PREVIOUS REMARKS: It was previously mentioned that visual effects have no effecttype. This is incorrect, this function will return EFFECT_TYPE_VISUALEFFECT for visual effects.
