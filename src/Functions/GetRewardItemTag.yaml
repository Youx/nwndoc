type: Function
name: GetRewardItemTag
shortdesc: Returns the reward item tag.
return: string
parameters:
  - type: object
    name: oTarget
    default: OBJECT_SELF
    desc: | The quest giver (Default: OBJECT_SELF)

  - type: int
    name: nQuest
    default: 1
    desc: | The quest number (Default: 1)

description: |
  Return the tag used for the given NPC's reward item for the specified quest.
remarks: |
  Takes the tag of oTarget, appends _RI and nQuest, and returns it. So, if oTarget's tag is "BOB", and nQuest is 1, this function returns BOB_RI1 - this string is used by other functions as a local variable name. 
  This is part of BioWare's quest handling system. Unless you delve thoroughly into that system, and use it all the time, you probably won't need this function.
