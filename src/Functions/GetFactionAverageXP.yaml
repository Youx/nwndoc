type: Function
name: GetFactionAverageXP
shortdesc: Get the average amount of XPs for all members in an objects faction.
return: int
parameters:
  - type: object
    name: oFactionMember
    desc: | The object whose faction you wish to examine.

description: |
  Returns the average number of experience points of the members of the faction (party). 
  Return value on error: -1 
  It is unknown if NPC's in a PC's faction affects this function call and the returned result, such sa summoned monsters, henchmen and familiars, or if those creatures can be used as the oFactionMember at all.
remarks: |
  Another way of figuring out the overall level of a faction, although more accurate then GetFactionAverageLevel() if you want to know how close they are to one level or another. 
  This will work exactly the same was as using GetFirst/NextFactionMemeber() and using GetXP(), only is much easier to code and probably better on performance. 
  Try to never use this on an NPC faction, only a PC's party faction, because NPC factions usually have dozens of NPC's, and thus may cause a lot of high CPU usage with faction calls such as this.

example: |
  // If the PC's experience, on average, is over 4000XP (an arbitary
  // number, between levels) then give the PC speaker 100 gold.
  void main()
  {
      // Get the PC
      object oPC = GetPCSpeaker();
      // Get the faction's XP
      int nXP = GetFactionAverageXP(oPC);
      // Check the amount
      if(nXP >= 4000)
      {
           // Reward them
           SpeakString("I see we are learning fast. Here is some gold!");
            GiveGoldToCreature(oPC, 100);
      }
  }
