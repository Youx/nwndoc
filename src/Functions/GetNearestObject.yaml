type: Function
name: GetNearestObject
shortdesc: Gets the nearest object, which matches given criteria, to the selected target.
return: object
parameters:
  - type: int
    name: nObjectType
    default: OBJECT_TYPE_ALL
    desc: | OBJECT_TYPE_* (Default: OBJECT_TYPE_ALL)

  - type: object
    name: oTarget
    default: OBJECT_SELF
    desc: | (Default: OBJECT_SELF)

  - type: int
    name: nNth
    default: 1
    desc: | (Default: 1)

description: |
  Get the Nth object nearest to oTarget that is of the specified type. 
  Return value on error: OBJECT_INVALID 
  The function returns the Nth (default is 1, i.e. nearest) object that matches specified type. By default ‘type’ is set to OBJECT_TYPE_ALL, therefore the function will return the Nth nearest valid object unless you specify a type in the form OBJECT_TYPE_* (see end of description for a complete list of valid object types). Also by default the oTARGET is equal to OBJECT_SELF but may be set to another object. 
  For example, the following script snippet would set object oNearestDoor to the third nearest door to the object oPC: 
  object oNearestDoor = GetNearestObject(OBJECT_TYPE_DOOR, oPC, 3) 
  List of available object types constants: 
  OBJECT_TYPE_ALL (default) 
  OBJECT_TYPE_AREA_OF_EFFECT 
  OBJECT_TYPE_CREATURE 
  OBJECT_TYPE_DOOR 
  OBJECT_TYPE_ITEM 
  OBJECT_TYPE_PLACEABLE 
  OBJECT_TYPE_STORE 
  OBJECT_TYPE_TRIGGER 
  OBJECT_TYPE_WAYPOINT
remarks: |
  It can only return objects in oTarget's area, as GetNearestObjectByTag does, and is intended behaviour. 
  Obviously, this also means Modules and Areas cannot return a valid value for this.
version: 1.22
example: |
  // This script is for a bar maid tagged "BAR_MAID".
  // The bar maid will find the third nearest door
  // and attempt to walk to it.
  void main
  {
       // Initialize objects.
       object oBarMaid = GetObjectByTag("BAR_MAID");
       object oDoor = GetNearestObject(OBJECT_TYPE_DOOR, oBarMaid, 3)
       // Bar maid walks to the third nearest door.
       ActionForceMoveToObject(oDoor)
