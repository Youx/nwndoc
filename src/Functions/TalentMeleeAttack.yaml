type: Function
name: TalentMeleeAttack
shortdesc: Determines course of action while in melee combat for all NPCs.
return: int
parameters:
  - type: object
    name: oIntruder
    default: OBJECT_INVALID
    desc: | (Default: OBJECT_INVALID)

description: |
  The main attack routine for creatures. Checks to ensure target and calling creature are in same area, then runs through a 3 phase check. All phases check to ensure target creature is valid, is not dead, is in the same area as OBJECT_SELF. 
  Three phases are: 1) Determines to attack last creature attacked, 
  2) Determines to attack a new target that is attacking OBJECT_SELF. 3) Determines to attack a new hostile seen or heard. 
  If none of these phases come up with a target, no attack is made. If a target is received, it analyzes targets AC and current level of OBJECT_SELF. 
remarks: |
  If the hostile creatures AC minus the resulting value above is below 10 (nDiff) the function checks to see if OBJECT_SELF has capability of disarming foe (or another feat), if so, it does this form of attack. IF nDiff is higher than 10, a normal melee attack is attempted. 
remarks: |
  In the scripting, the 75% multiplier is near a commented line giving 100% of the NPCs HD in addition to Strength modifier. 
  This function is located in x0_i0_talent, but including nw_i0_generic will suffice.
requirements: |
  #include "nw_i0_generic"
