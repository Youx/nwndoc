type: Function
name: GetLastRestEventType
shortdesc: Determines the status of the last PC rest.
return: int
parameters:
description: |
  Determine the type (REST_EVENTTYPE_REST_*) of the last rest event (as returned from the OnPlayerRest module event).
remarks: |
  The OnPlayerRest event will fire in three different events: 
  -A PC begins to rest 
  -A PC's rest is cancelled 
  -A PC successfully finished resting (not cancelled) 
  Thus, resting will always fire the OnPlayerRest event twice: Once when the rest starts, and again when it is either finished or cancelled. 
  The REST_EVENTTYPE_REST_INVALID should only occur on error, and if you strictly use this function in the OnPlayerRest event, that should never happen.
version: 1.61
example: |
  //Example structure of a OnPlayerRest event script
  void main()
  {
  object oPC=GetLastPCRested();
  int nRestType=GetLastRestEventType();
  switch (nRestType)
     {
     case REST_EVENTTYPE_REST_STARTED:
        SendMessageToPC(oPC, "You start resting");
        break;
     case REST_EVENTTYPE_REST_FINISHED:
        SendMessageToPC(oPC, "Had a good night's sleep?");
        break;
     case REST_EVENTTYPE_REST_CANCELLED:
        SendMessageToPC(oPC, "WAKE UP!!!");
        break;
     default:
        SendMessageToPC(oPC, "You should never see this");
     }
  }
