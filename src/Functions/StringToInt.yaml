type: Function
name: StringToInt
shortdesc: Converts a string to an integer.
return: int
parameters:
  - type: string
    name: sNumber
    desc: | The string to convert into an integer.

description: |
  Returns the value of sNumber converted to an integer. 
  Returns 0 on error.
remarks: |
  One place this would be useful is to do something based on what is heard when an NPC is listening. 
  It is impossible, without doing some extra checks, to determine if a return value of 0 comes from an error or from the string "0". An example of how to check it is listed below.
version: 1.61
example: |
  //Function to check if a string is just an integer number
  int GetStringIsIntegerNumber(string sString)
  {
  int nString=StringToInt(sString);
  //any value other than 0 means the string is just an integer number
  if (nString!=0) return TRUE;
  //Check if the string representation of nString is the same as sString.
  //If it is, this will have happened:
  //"0" converted to 0, converted back to "0"
  //An example of 0 produced by an error:
  //"bob" converted to 0, converted to "0". "bob" != "0"
  string sCompare=IntToString(nString);
  return sCompare==sString;
  }
