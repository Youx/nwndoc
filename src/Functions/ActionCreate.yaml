type: Function
name: ActionCreate
shortdesc: Used to encapsulate CreateObject allowing this function to be added to the action stack.
return: void
parameters:
  - type: string
    name: sCreature
    desc: | The resref of the creature to create

  - type: location
    name: lLoc
    desc: | a location object identifying the location to create the creature

description: |
  This function essentially wraps the CreateObject function in a void method so that it can be placed on the action que. It is used in the OnHeartbeat of the placable object "Skeleton Bones" found in the Battlefield pallate.
remarks: |
  "nw_o2_skeleton.nss" might be a good place to start if you wanted objects to turn into creatures when the player approached. 
  "nw_o2_skeleton" cannot be included in a script that has a "void main()" function definition. This is because "nw_o2_skeleton" defines a "void main()" function. If you want to use this function, make a copy from "nw_o2_skeleton" into your own script.
requirements: |
  #include "nw_o2_skeleton"
version: 1.28
example: |
  string sCreature = "NW_SKELWARR01";
  location lLoc = GetLocation(OBJECT_SELF);
  DelayCommand(0.3, ActionCreate(sCreature, lLoc));
  /* ***
  ** The DelayCommand message above could be replaced with
  ** ActionDoCommand(ActionCreate(sCreature, lLoc));
  *** */
