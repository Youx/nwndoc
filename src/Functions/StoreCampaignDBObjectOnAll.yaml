description: |
  Given a PC, variable name and object tag, stores a campaign database object on all Player Character members of the PC's party.
remarks: |
  Does not include associates. 
  This does not store a reference, it stores the entire actual object, 
  including all of its inventory. Storing many objects can be highly resource-intensive! It should NOT be used like Set/GetLocalObject. 
  Include library for party-wide functions. 
  NOTE: this library is included in "x0_i0_common" already. 
  Do NOT dual-include both files or you will get errors!
