type: Function
name: SetLocked
shortdesc: Locks or unlocks a door or placeable.
return: void
parameters:
  - type: object
    name: oTarget
    desc: | The door or placeable to lock

  - type: int
    name: bLocked
    desc: | TRUE to lock, FALSE to unlock.

description: |
  Used by objects or creatures to set the locked status of an object or placeable without checking the Open Locks skill. 
  Note that DM Force Lock does the same thing as this. You can actually lock doors which cannot be normally re-locked, but it is not recommended.
remarks: |
  Alternatively, ActionLockObject and ActionUnlockObject can be used by creatures so appropriate skill checks are made. Make sure, as well, that your door has the 're-lockable' box checked. 
  You can lock an open door. If you do, it will be locked once it closes.
version: 1.61
example: |
  // Unlocked an object with the tag DOOR_TAG
  void main()
  {
      object oDoor = GetObjectByTag("DOOR_TAG");
      SetLocked(oDoor, FALSE);
  }
