  Returns the default package selected for this creature to level up with - returns PACKAGE_INVALID if error occurs.
remarks: |
  Returns a value of type PACKAGE_*. This function may be useful in conjunction with LevelUpHenchman. 
  This is also the value set in the toolset creature properties - under the "Class" section. This should always be valid in any module with this function, and every class has a default one (For example Outsiders do have a default levelup package).
