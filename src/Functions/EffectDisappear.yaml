shortdesc: Returns a new effect object.
return: effect
parameters:
description: |
  Create a Disappear effect to make the object "fly away" and then destroy itself. 
  It is likely, if the creature this is applied to is Plot, has SetDestroyable(FALSE) previously set, or is Immortal, this will fail or go wrong. 
  This doesn't fire the creatures OnDeath event, it is almost as if it had called DestroyObject() on itself after the animation. 
  Do NOT use on a PC! Like DestroyObject() it will either fail to work, or in this case, as it is an effect, may crash the game! 
  The target this effect is applied to must be a creature for it to work. This effect can only be applied instantly.
remarks: |
  To fly from point to point and keep the creatures hit points, spells and so forth, use EffectDisappearAppear(). 
  This is not to be used on PC creature objects! 
  Effect functions are Constructors, which are special methods that help construct effect "objects". You can declare effects, and apply them using an ApplyEffectToObject() Command. See the Effect Tutorial for more details.
version: 1.62
example: |
  // Sample code for applying a disappear effect to a target
  void main()
  {
      // This is the Object to apply the effect to.
      object oTarget = OBJECT_SELF;
      // Create the effect to apply
      effect eGo = EffectDisappear();
      // Create the visual portion of the effect. This is instantly
      // applied and not persistant with wether or not we have the
      // above effect.
      effect eVis = EffectVisualEffect(VFX_IMP_PULSE_WIND);
      // Apply the visual effect to the target
      ApplyEffectToObject(DURATION_TYPE_INSTANT, eVis, oTarget);
      // Apply the effect to the object   
      ApplyEffectToObject(DURATION_TYPE_INSTANT, eGo, oTarget);
  }
