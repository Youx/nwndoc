type: Function
name: GetCasterLevel
shortdesc: Determines the level of caster for a creature or PC casting a spell.
return: int
parameters:
  - type: object
    name: oCreature
    desc: | Creature or PC casting a spell.

description: |
  Get the Caster Level of oCreature. If the creature or PC is multiclassed, this function returns the level of the class used to cast the spell. 
  Return a value of 0 on error.
remarks: |
  This only works with PC and creature type objects, else it returns 0. 
  This function only works properly when oCreature is casting a spell. It is cirtainly the only reliable place. If used outside a spell script, it will return the last caster level of the last spell cast by oCreature - IE, some Area-of-Effect spells do this, to get how much damage dice to use.
version: 1.61
example: |
  // Example 1 - Gets the casting level of the object that last cast
  // a spell, if that object is a PC or Creature.  For fun, the object
  // then says its caster level.
  /* note the bug above; this example may not work properly */
  void main()
  {
    // Get the object that last cast a spell.
    object oCreature = GetLastSpellCaster();
    // Get out if it is not a creature (PC or mob)
    if (GetObjectType(oCreature) != OBJECT_TYPE_CREATURE) return;
    // Get the casting level of the creature.
    int nCLevel = GetCasterLevel(oCreature);
    // Just for fun...
    string sLevel = IntToString(nCLevel);
    AssignCommand(oCreature,SpeakString("I'm a level " + sLevel + " caster!",TALKVOLUME_TALK));
