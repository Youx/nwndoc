type: Function
name: ItemPropertyDecreaseAbility
shortdesc: Sets a decrease ability itemproperty.
return: itemproperty
parameters:
  - type: int
    name: nAbility
    desc: | IP_CONST_ABILITY_*

  - type: int
    name: nModifier
    desc: | Amount to decrease by; 1 to 10 are valid.

description: |
  Sets item property Decrease ability score. You must specify the ability constant (IP_CONST_ABILITY_*), such as Charisma or Wisdom, and the modifier constant. The modifier must be a POSITIVE integer between 1 and 10, by which the ability score is reduced.
remarks: |
  The itemproperty commands are special constructors - they construct an itemproperty "object" which can then be applied to an item using the AddItemProperty command, much like effects need to be first constructed, then applied with ApplyEffectToObject. 
  It will often be a good idea to remove similar itemproperties from the item first. There's a command in the "x2_inc_itemprop" include file called IPSafeAddItemProperty which will do that for you. Check IPSafeAddItemProperty for current bug report. 
  The IP_CONST_ABILITY_* constant can be retrieved off this type of item property using GetItemPropertySubType. The modifier can be retrieved using GetItemPropertCostTableValue.
version: 1.61
example: |
  #include "x2_inc_itemprop"
  //The include is for the IPSafeAddItemProperty function
  //Makes the PC speaker's helmet cause stupidity :-(
  void main()
  {
  object oPC=GetPCSpeaker();
  object oItem = GetItemInSlot(INVENTORY_SLOT_HEAD, oPC);
  if (!GetIsObjectValid(oItem)) return;
  itemproperty ipAdd = ItemPropertyDecreaseAbility(IP_CONST_ABILITY_INT, 5);
  IPSafeAddItemProperty(oItem, ipAdd);
  }
