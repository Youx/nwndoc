type: Function
name: ItemPropertyBonusSavingThrowVsX
shortdesc: Sets a "saving throw bonus" itemproperty.
return: itemproperty
parameters:
  - type: int
    name: nBonusType
    desc: | IP_CONST_SAVEVS_*

  - type: int
    name: nBonus
    desc: | Saving throw bonus; 1 to 20 are valid.

description: |
  Sets item property Saving throw bonus vs. a specific effect or damage type, such as Acid, Cold, Death Magic, Disease, another 9 types and Universal. 
  You must specify the save type constant (IP_CONST_SAVEVS_*) that the bonus is applied to and the bonus that is be applied, which should be an integer between 1 and 20.
remarks: |
  The itemproperty commands are special constructors - they construct an itemproperty "object" which can then be applied to an item using the AddItemProperty command, much like effects need to be first constructed, then applied with ApplyEffectToObject. 
  It will often be a good idea to remove similar itemproperties from the item first. There's a command in the "x2_inc_itemprop" include file called IPSafeAddItemProperty which will do that for you. Check IPSafeAddItemProperty for current bug report. 
  The IP_CONST_SAVEVS_* constant can be retrieved off this type of item property using GetItemPropertySubType. The bonus can be retrieved using GetItemPropertCostTableValue.

example: |
  #include "x2_inc_itemprop"
  //The include is for the IPSafeAddItemProperty function
  //Makes the first PC's helmet give +15 to saving throws
  //against mind-affecting spells
  void main()
  {
  object oPC = GetFirstPC();
  object oItem = GetItemInSlot(INVENTORY_SLOT_HEAD, oPC);
  if (!GetIsObjectValid(oItem)) return;
  itemproperty ipAdd = ItemPropertyBonusSavingThrowVsX(IP_CONST_SAVEVS_MINDAFFECTING, 15);
  IPSafeAddItemProperty(oItem, ipAdd);
  }
