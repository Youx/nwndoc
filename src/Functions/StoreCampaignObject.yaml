description: |
  Stores an item or creature in the campaign database. Campaign names are case-sensitive. Returns 1 if successful, 0 if the function fails. Only items or creatures can be stored using this function. 
  If it is a creature, all inventory items and local variables are also stored (and are retrieved when recalled) and so this function can be very CPU intensive if used often.
remarks: |
  It is unknown that if by specifying oPlayer that the sVarName must still be unique. 
  As of HotU/1.62, local variables are stored in the database - including any on items possessed if the object stored is a creature.
