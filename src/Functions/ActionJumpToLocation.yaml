type: Function
name: ActionJumpToLocation
shortdesc: Instantly sends the calling object to the position of locTarget.
return: void
parameters:
  - type: location
    name: locTarget
    desc: | Target location

description: |
  The calling object will be instantly relocated to the position of locTarget (or as near to it as possible). This function will work within or across area borders. 
  If locTarget isn't a valid object (or is unspecified) the function call will fail.
remarks: |
  There is no visual effect associated with this action; you must create it yourself. Using ApplyEffectAtLocation() and ApplyEffectAtObject() combined with an EffectVisualEffect() effect is great for doing this. 
  Location values can easily be acquired using the GetLocation() function, or set with the Location() function. 
  When a PC leaves an Area or Trigger because you've jumped to a location causes the OnExit event of the departed object to fire. 
  Does not affect creatures that are dead; they must have HP above 0 for this function to work properly.
version: 1.26
example: |
  // This script will send the calling object to the coordinates
  // specified by the vPosition vector.
  // ActionJumpToLocation the hard way
  void main()
  {
     area aCurrentArea = GetArea(OBJECT_SELF);
     vector vPosition = Vector(2.0, 3.0, 0.0); // x:2, y:3, z:0
     location locTarget = Location(aCurrentArea, vPosition, 90.0);
     ActionJumpToLocation(locTarget);
  }
