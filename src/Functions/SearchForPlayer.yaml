description: |
  The nearest seen PC is obtained with a GetNearestCreature command. If no PC is found, the guard will scratch his head, and there’s a 30% chance he will speak a oneliner conversation. If a PC is found, the guard will attack that PC.
remarks: |
  Found in nw_c2_recruit1.nss line 16 
  Note that nw_c2_recruit1 isn’t an include file. It has a void main() function, which means that you cannot include that file the normal way. The best way to use the SearchForPlayer function is probably to copy it into your script.
