shortdesc: This function sets the effects sub type to magical.
return: effect
parameters:
  - type: effect
    name: eEffect
description: |
  Effects are one of three SUBTYPE_* (EXTRAODINARY, MAGICAL, SUPERNATURAL). This function sets the specified effects subtype to SUBTYPE_MAGICAL. Acts as a mutator for an effects subtype. 
  Effects, by default, start as magical and there is normally no need to use this function. 
  Maigcal effects can be dispelled (if applied from a spell script) and removed when resting. 
  If you put a link of effects as eEffect, then the entire link and all the effects within it are made magical. 
  You cannot change exsisting effect's subtypes with this function, only ones you have created via. the "effect" declaration.
remarks: |
  SUBTYPTE_MAGICAL is the default subtype for all effects. See 3rd Edition DMG page 71 or MM page 7 for a description of ability classifications.
version: 1.62

      object oPC = GetFirstPC();
      //Make it a magical effect…
      ePolymorph = MagicalEffect(ePolymorph);
      //Apply the affect…
      ApplyEffectToObject (DURATION_TYPE_TEMPORARY, ePolymorph, oPC, 300.0);
