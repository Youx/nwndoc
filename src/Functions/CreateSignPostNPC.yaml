description: |
  The main purpose of this function is to use the action queue to spawn creatures. 
  It is basically a simplified form of CreateObject that allows only creatures to be created. The main benefit of this function over CreateObject is that is has a void return type which allows it to be placed into the action queue using the ActionDoCommand function.
