type: Function
name: GetIsWeaponEffective
shortdesc: Check whether script owner's equipped weapon is able to damage a given object.
return: int
parameters:
  - type: object
    name: oVersus
    default: OBJECT_INVALID
    desc: | Object to test weapon against. (Default: OBJECT_INVALID)

  - type: int
    name: bOffHand
    default: FALSE
    desc: | Check weapon equipped in off-hand? (Default: FALSE)

description: |
  Returns TRUE if it's possible for the script's owner to damage the given object with its equipped weapon. If bOffHand=TRUE, then the off-hand weapon is tested.
remarks: |
  This function must be called from a script which is "owned" by the creature whose weapon is to be tested. 
  The oVersus argument need not be a creature. For example, using a chest as the argument would normally return TRUE, but if the chest's plot flag is checked, then this function will return FALSE. 
  Also, an actual weapon need not be present. If no weapon is equipped, the creature's bare-handed attack is tested.
