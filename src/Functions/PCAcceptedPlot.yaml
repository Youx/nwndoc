remarks: |
  Found in nw_j_assassin.nss on line 283 
  I am not sure where this local variable is set. Probably by a script that fires when PC accepts the assassination plot. There’s no really good reason to use Bioware’s function for this – you’d be better off making a system of your own so you know exactly how and when everything works.
