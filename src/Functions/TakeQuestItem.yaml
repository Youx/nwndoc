description: |
  Remove a quest item from a PC.
remarks: |
  This function assumes that the item to be removed is unique. If several copies of the item is found within oPC's party, only one of them will be taken. 
  The item is not actually taken, it is simply destroyed. 
  This is part of BioWare's quest handling system. Unless you delve thoroughly into that system, and use it all the time, you probably won't need this function.
