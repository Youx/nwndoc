type: Function
name: GetFirstObjectInShape
shortdesc: Determines the first object of a specific type (creature, door etc.) in shape.
return: object
parameters:
  - type: int
    name: nShape
    desc: | SHAPE_*

  - type: float
    name: fSize
    desc: | The size of the shape (look at description for more information) or RADIUS_SIZE_*.

  - type: location
    name: lTarget
    desc: | The starting location of the shape.

  - type: int
    name: bLineOfSight
    default: FALSE
    desc: | This can be used to ensure that spell effects do not go through walls. (Default: FALSE)

  - type: int
    name: nObjectFilter
    default: OBJECT_TYPE_CREATURE
    desc: | Restrict results to this object type (OBJECT_TYPE_*). (Default: OBJECT_TYPE_CREATURE)

  - type: vector
    name: vOrigin
    default: [0.0,0.0,0.0]
    desc: | Normally the spell-caster's position. (Default: [0.0,0.0,0.0])

  Returns the first object that is within the specified nShape and fSize and OBJECT_INVALID if no objects are contained. 
  The meaning of fSize depends on nShape: 
  If nShape == SHAPE_SPHERE, fSize is the radius of the sphere. 
  If nShape == SHAPE_SPELLCYLINDER, fSize is the radius of the cylinder. 
  If nShape == SHAPE_CONE, fSize is the widest radius of the cone. 
  If nShape == SHAPE_CUBE, fSize is half the length of one of the sides of the cube. 
  For example, to return only creatures and doors, the value for this parameter would be OBJECT_TYPE_CREATURE | OBJECT_TYPE_DOOR 
bugs: |
  This function does not appear to return OBJECT_TYPE_PLACEABLE objects, either by using that keyword or OBJECT_TYPE_ALL. 
  Some users have reported that the SHAPE_CONE is not shaped as a cone, and the fact that the constant is only used in one function call throughout the entire official campaign, leads me to believe it may be a bit buggy. 
  For the SHAPE_SPELLCONE constant, appears lTarget is used for cone angle, ltarget is fSize away in direction of lTarget. "vOrigin" is ignored - it is NOT origin of cone -- origin of cone is location of OBJECT_SELF. 
  For the SHAPE_SPELLCYLINDER, "fSize" is actually LENGTH of cylinder 
  "end" of cylinder is "fSize" along line from vOrigin to lTarget. 
  cylinder width (diameter) is ALWAYS approx. 10 feet?

  // From the Bioware script that implements the burning hands spell

  oTarget = GetFirstObjectInShape(SHAPE_SPELLCONE, 10.0, GetSpellTargetLocation(), TRUE, OBJECT_TYPE_CREATURE | OBJECT_TYPE_DOOR | OBJECT_TYPE_PLACEABLE);
  //Cycle through the targets within the spell shape until an invalid object is captured.
  while(GetIsObjectValid(oTarget))
  {
     if(!GetIsReactionTypeFriendly(oTarget))
     {
        // Handle saving throws, damage, effects etc.
     }
     //Select the next target within the spell shape.
     oTarget = GetNextObjectInShape(SHAPE_SPELLCONE, 10.0, GetSpellTargetLocation(), TRUE, OBJECT_TYPE_CREATURE | OBJECT_TYPE_DOOR | OBJECT_TYPE_PLACEABLE);
  }
