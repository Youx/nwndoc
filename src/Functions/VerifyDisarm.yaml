type: Function
name: VerifyDisarm
shortdesc: Determines whether a creature could possibly be disarmed.
return: int
parameters:
  - type: talent
    name: tUse
    desc: | Should be the feat "Disarm" (FEAT_DISARM).

  - type: object
    name: oTarget
    desc: | The creature that would be the target of a disarm attempt.

description: |
  Checks that the melee talent being used is Disarm and if so then if the target has a weapon. 
  This should return TRUE if: 
  - we are not trying to use disarm 
  - we are using disarm appropriately 
  This should return FALSE if: 
  - we are trying to use disarm on an inappropriate target 
  - we are using disarm too frequently 
remarks: |
  This has nothing to do with disarming traps. 
  In Shadows of Undrentide, this function has been moved to X0_I0_MATCH. You can still use it by just including nw_i0_generic, though.
bugs: |
  This isnâ€™t really a bug, but if a talent other than the disarm talent is fed to the function, it will return TRUE.
requirements: |
  #include "NW_I0_GENERIC"
version: 1.30
