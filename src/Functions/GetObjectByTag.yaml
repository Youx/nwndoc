type: Function
name: GetObjectByTag
shortdesc: Retrieves an object based on the tag given to it.
return: object
parameters:
  - type: string
    name: sTag
    desc: | The tag of the object to search for.

  - type: int
    name: nNth
    default: 0
    desc: | The Nth object with this tag may be requested. (Default: 0)

description: |
  Returns the nNth object of the specified tag or OBJECT_INVALID if the object cannot be found. 
  sString cannot be "", this will return OBJECT_INVALID.
remarks: |
  The nNth parameter has been determined to return the nNth object with the specified sTag starting at position 0. Outside of the current area, the scan will begin starting with the last (most recent) area added to the module following this hierarchy: 
  OBJECT_TYPE_STORE (128) 
  OBJECT_TYPE_PLACEABLE (64) 
  OBJECT_TYPE_WAYPOINT (32) 
  OBJECT_TYPE_AREA_OF_EFFECT (16) (spell effects, like web) 
  OBJECT_TYPE_DOOR (8) 
  OBJECT_TYPE_TRIGGER (4) 
  OBJECT_TYPE_ITEM (2) 
  OBJECT_TYPE_CREATURE (1) 
  GetObjectByTag can also be used to get areas, but not the module (use GetModule() instead). It is unknown what will be returned if an area has the same tag as a non-object area.
bugs: |
  The feature of "" returning player characters (IE: Those objects without a tag) has been fixed or changed in 1.64, and now properly returns OBJECT_INVLAID.
version: 1.61
example: |
  // Demonstrates how to retrieve an object with the GetObjectByTag() funciton and apply a spell effect to it.
  void main()
  {
       //makes the world appear dark to NPC Bob
       ApplyEffectToObject(DURATION_TYPE_PERMANENT, EffectDarkness(), GetObjectByTag("NPC_BOB"));
  }
