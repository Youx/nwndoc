description: |
  Returns the victim of the assassin, stored by the SetVictim command as a local object ("NW_J_ASSASSIN_VICTIM") on the assassin.
remarks: |
  Found in nw_j_assassin.nss on line 366 
  Called by the function (also in nw_j_assassin) VictimDead, which returns TRUE if the object stored in "NW_J_ASSASSIN_VICTIM" isn’t valid, i.e. has been killed. 
  This is part of Bioware’s own quest and reward system. It is hardly useful for anyone not copying that system to the very last detail.
