type: Function
name: TakeGoldFromCreature
shortdesc: Takes a specified amount of gold away from a creature.
return: void
parameters:
  - type: int
    name: nAmount
    desc: | The amount in gold pieces to take a way

  - type: object
    name: oCreatureToTakeFrom
    desc: | If this is not a valid creature, nothing will happen.

  - type: int
    name: bDestroy
    default: FALSE
    desc: | If this is TRUE, the caller will not get the gold. Instead, the gold will be destroyed and will vanish from the game. (Default: FALSE)

description: |
  Take nAmount of gold from oCreatureToTakeFrom. 
  The taker needs to be a non-area and non-module for it to work correctly. It can be the creature passed into oCreatureToTakeFrom, of course.
remarks: |
  Although the default value for bDestroy is FALSE the most common usage is TRUE. In fact, Bioware has created a function TakeGold (in NW_I0_TOOL) that takes the same parameters except defaults bDestroy to TRUE (and subsequently calls this function). 
  This function will fail if called from an area or module event (like an area's OnEnter). However, it works on triggers, so you can just paint a trigger around the arrival area to get the same effect.
version: 1.61
example: |
  // This is taken from Bioware's Respawning code
  // * Applies an XP and GP penalty to the player respawning
  void ApplyPenalty(object oDead)
  {
      int nXP = GetXP(oDead);
      int nPenalty = 50 * GetHitDice(oDead);
      int nHD = GetHitDice(oDead);
      // * You can not lose a level with this respawning
      int nMin = ((nHD * (nHD - 1)) / 2) * 1000;
      int nNewXP = nXP - nPenalty;
      if (nNewXP < nMin)
         nNewXP = nMin;
      SetXP(oDead, nNewXP);
      int nGoldToTake =    FloatToInt(0.10 * GetGold(oDead));
      // * a cap of 10 000gp taken from you
      if (nGoldToTake > 10000)
      {
          nGoldToTake = 10000;
      }
      AssignCommand(oDead, TakeGoldFromCreature(nGoldToTake, oDead, TRUE));
      DelayCommand(4.0, FloatingTextStrRefOnCreature(58299, oDead, FALSE));
      DelayCommand(4.8, FloatingTextStrRefOnCreature(58300, oDead, FALSE));
  }
