  Simply returns a string: “way”+IntToString(nNumber)+GetTag(OBJECT_SELF). 
  (eg. “way1cr_karl” for a creature tagged cr_karl, when nNumber is 1). 
remarks: |
  Found in nw_c3_waypoint1.nss line 27 
  Note that nw_c3_waypoint1 is not an include file and cannot be used as such. This function is used in that script to find the tag of the next waypoint to walk to. You’ll probably be much better off using the WalkWayPoints command in nw_i0_generic.
