type: Function
name: GetIsResting
shortdesc: Check whether a creature is resting.
return: int
parameters:
  - type: object
    name: oCreature
    default: OBJECT_SELF
    desc: | Creature to be checked. (Default: OBJECT_SELF)

description: |
  Returns TRUE if oCreature is currently resting. Otherwise, returns FALSE.
remarks: |
  Note that applying effects such as EffectSleep() or animations such as ANIMATION_LOOPING_SIT_CROSS do not count. Only if a PC has selected his or her "rest" function, or if an NPC has been given the ActionRest() script command will this function return TRUE.
bugs: |
  Prior to 1.28, this function always returned FALSE if called outside of the event OnPlayerRest.
version: 1.28
example: |
  // Creature On Percieve script - if we see a PC who is sleeping, we
  // will go "bonk some 'eads!"
  void main()
  {
      // Get creature percieved
      object oSeen = GetLastPerceived();
      // Get is can see it, or rather, we can now see it. Must also be a PC.
      if(GetLastPerceptionSeen() && GetIsPC(oSeen))
      {
          // Lets go bonk thier head if they are resting
          if(GetIsResting(oSeen))
          {
              SpeakString("'ere, you need bonking on der 'ead!");
              ClearAllActions();
              ActionAttack(oSeen);
          }
      }
  }
