type: Function
name: Get2DAString
shortdesc: Retrieves a string value from a *.2da file on a server.
return: string
parameters:
  - type: string
    name: s2DA
    desc: | Name of the *.2DA file on the server.

  - type: string
    name: sColumn
    desc: | Name of the column within the *.2DA file.

  - type: int
    name: nRow
    desc: | Row number within the *.2DA file.

description: |
  Returns the value of a string in the given location of a specified *.2da file. Returns an empty string if file, column, or row is not found. Returns "" (empty string) for "****" entries in the *.2da. 
  Get2daString() now is cached the first time it is called, into the memory of the computer. Basically - you can now use this function in a loop with a lot less noticable loss of speed! 
  Obviously now you cannot change 2da files dynamically out of game, and see changes in-game.
remarks: |
  You can now loop using this function. It will now work (or should work) as fast as the game would itself getting information from a 2da file. Likely, there now should be no noticable loss of speed compared to pre-1.64. If there is loss of speed - it'll be greatly improved upon pre-1.64. 
  Do not prefix your own *.2da files with the prefix "des_". 
  The maximum length for a *.2da file is 16 characters. If you specify a longer file name, the function will fail without warning.
bugs: |
  The maximum length of a field within a *.2da file is 267 characters. Anything longer than that will cause NWN to crash. 
  Although not a bug, the changes to this in 1.64 means you cannot change a 2da file out-of-game, and it change the results in-game. This is intended 1.64 behaviour.
version: 1.64
example: |
  // Return TRUE if weapon does bludgeoning damage
  // Uses Get2DAString
  int GetDoesBludgeoningDamage(object oWeapon)
  {
      int nBaseType = GetBaseType(oWeapon);
      return (StringToInt(Get2DAString("baseitems","WeaponType",nBaseType) == 2);
      // 2 = bludgeoning
  }
