parameters:
  - type: object
    name: oTrapObject
    desc: | a placeable, door or trigger

description: |
  Returns TRUE if trap is disarmable. This is only done in the toolset, all traps placed by PC's in-game (and DM's) are automatically disarmable.
remarks: |
  Undisarmable traps can still be disarmed with SetTrapDisabled(), therefore, it is a good way to have special traps which only a lever can disable.
