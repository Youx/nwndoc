type: Function
name: GetPLocalInt
shortdesc: Determines the value of a locally stored variable from any PC in a party.
return: int
parameters:
  - type: object
    name: oPC
    desc: | PC whose party will be searched for the local variable.

  - type: string
    name: sLocalName
    desc: | Local variable name to get the value.

description: |
  Scans through all players in the party, to treat them all as a single entity for the purposes of most plots. This makes BioWare plots more multi-player friendly.
remarks: |
  Although not absolutely necessary, SetPLocalInt should be used. SetPLocalInt sets a local variable to all party members. With these two functions a multiplayer game can handle some players leaving and new players entering mid game. 
  GetPLocalInt is short for GetPartyLocalInt. 
  Same as aGetPLocalInt(object, string).
requirements: |
