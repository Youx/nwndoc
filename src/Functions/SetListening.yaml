type: Function
name: SetListening
shortdesc: Sets whether an object should listen.
return: void
parameters:
  - type: object
    name: oObject
    desc: | The object to set the listening status.

  - type: int
    name: bValue
    desc: | TRUE if the object should listen, otherwise FALSE.

description: |
  Sets whether oObject should listen for listening patterns set on it. 
  Note: It has no effect on if they will hear something with GetObjectHeard(). 
  Deafness has no effect on this (as such, deafness has no effect at all on any PC listening, so why should it affect NPC's!).
remarks: |
  GetIsListening will return TRUE or FALSE for this setting. 
  There is no way to reset listening patterns on a creature, or delete them, apart from changing and overriding ones already present of course. 
  SetListening(OBJECT_SELF, FALSE) will not reset anything, but mearly make no patterns heard, and GetIsListening(TRUE) will return FALSE. 
  SetListening(OBJECT_SELF, TRUE) will allow patterns to be heard - and it doesn't matter where it is called from (before or after patterns to listen to are set).
version: 1.62
example: |
  // Set a thief to listen, and listen for the phrase "Foggy" for a password. 
  // It will be number 40 in the conversation script, got by GetListenPatternNumber().
  void main()
  {
      SetListening(OBJECT_SELF, TRUE);
      SetListenPattern(OBJECT_SELF, "Foggy", 40);
  }
