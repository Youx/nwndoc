type: Function
name: log
donotindex: true
shortdesc: This function calculates the logarithmic value of fValue
return: float
parameters:
  - type: float
    name: fValue
    desc: | Float value to retrieve the logarithm of.

description: |
  Returns the natural logarithm of fValue, not the base 10 logarithm. To get the base 10 log^x log of fValue, use the code provided below. 
  A logarithm is an exponent used in mathematical calculations to depict the perceived levels of variable quantities such as visible light energy, electromagnetic field strength, and sound intensity.
remarks: |
  If you need to ask what a logarithm is you donâ€™t need to use this function. Logarithms are used to calculate the flight of an arrow and how far away a sound can be heard. 
  The only concieveable reason you might need it is to, from Bioware's own scripts, work out how long it takes a magic missile visual, or an acid arrow visual, to hit the target. Look in the appropriate spell script for the little snippits of code.

example: |
  // Work out e^25, the natural log of 25
  void main()
  {
      fNew = log(25.0);
  }
  // Function for getting log base 10 value of fValue
  float log_10(float fValue)
  {
      return log(fValue)/log(10);
  }
  // Example provided by slow slosh, a use of log() proving
  // it is the natural log.
  // Gets a challenge rating of oPC. A more accurate or better
  // way of using this function is to have something to get the total
  // value of all items possessed by oPC, rather then just GetGold()
  float GetPCChallengeRating(object oPC) {
      float fTGold = IntToFloat(GetGold(oPC));
      float fCR;
      if(fTGold>3000.0) {
          fCR = pow((log(fTGold)-8.0), 1.55);
      } else {
          fCR = 0.0;
      }
      fCR += GetHitDice(oPC)-1.0;
      if(fCR<0.5) { fCR=0.5; }
      return fCR;
  }
