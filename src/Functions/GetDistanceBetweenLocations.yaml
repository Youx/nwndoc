type: Function
name: GetDistanceBetweenLocations
shortdesc: The distance in meters between two locations in the game.
return: float
parameters:
  - type: location
    name: lLocationA
    desc: | A location variable.

  - type: location
    name: lLocationB
    desc: | A location variable.

description: |
  Returns the distance in meters between two locations, or -1.0000 if the locations are in two different areas, or are invalid locations in some way. 
  This is useful for checking distances between any non-objects, random locations, or between a location (EG: a spell target location) and a object's location. 
  If it is two objects, it is usually easier and faster to call GetDistanceBetween().
remarks: |
  This also takes into account the Z-axis, and thusly isn't a direct measurement in only X and Y. To get a direct measurement (discounting the Z-axis) you must use Vectors. 
  Remember, the float value returned by this is in in-game meters. Each in-game tile is 10x10M.

example: |
  // Check the distance between me, and our pre-set location stored
  // on us (perhaps by our spawn script, to the location we spawned in
  // at). If over 20M away, we run back to it, even in combat.
  void main()
  {
      // Get the stored location.
      location lPost = GetLocalLocation(OBJECT_SELF, "MY_POST");
      // Get our location
      location lSelf = GetLocation(OBJECT_SELF);
      // Check the distance
      float fDistance = GetDistanceBetweenLocations(lPost, lSelf);
      // If fDistance is -1.0 (different area), or we are 20M 
      // away, we run back
      if(fDistance == -1.0 || fDistance >= 20.0)
      {
          // Move to the post.
          ClearAllActions();
          ActionMoveToLocation(lPost);
      }
  }
