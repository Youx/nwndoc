shortdesc: Retrieves the public version of the PC's CD key.
return: string
parameters:
  - type: object
    name: oPlayer
    desc: | The player whose CD key to retrieve.

  - type: int
    name: nSinglePlayerCDKey
    default: FALSE

description: |
  Returns the public version of the CD Key that oPlayer uses. The public CD key is 8 characters long and is not the CD key used to install NWN or an expansion.
remarks: |
  Most likely used with functions such as BootPC() to combat mischievious players from causing havok on persistant worlds. 
bugs: |
  Not a bug, but a caveat 
  OnClientLeave, the PC object (GetExitingObject) is still valid, but the player object (i.e. the human being logged into the server) is not. This means that there are a few things you can't do OnClientLeave. Namely, the GetPCPlayerName, GetPCIPAddress, and GetPCPublicCDKey will not work, since the player is no longer around to get that information from. This can be worked around by storing them as local strings on the PC, for instance OnClientEnter. See workaround below.
version: 1.67
example: |
  //Workaround for the caveat above 
  void main() 
  { 
  object oPC=GetEnteringObject(); 
  string sPlayerName=GetPCPlayerName(oPC); 
  string sIP=GetPCIPAddress(oPC); 
  string sKey=GetPCPublicCDKey(oPC); 
  SetLocalString(oPC, "player_name", sPlayerName); 
  SetLocalString(oPC, "player_ip", sIP); 
  SetLocalString(oPC, "player_cdkey", sKey); 
  }
