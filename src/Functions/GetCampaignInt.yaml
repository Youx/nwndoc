type: Function
name: GetCampaignInt
shortdesc: Retrieves an integer value from the campaign database.
return: int
parameters:
  - type: string
    name: sCampaignName
    desc: | Campaign name to store this variable under (case-sensitive)

  - type: string
    name: sVarName
    desc: | Unique variable name

  - type: object
    name: oPlayer
    default: OBJECT_INVALID
    desc: | Player this variable is attached to. (Default: OBJECT_INVALID)

description: |
  Returns an integer (int) value from the campaign database. The campaign name is case-sensitive. Returns 0 if the variable is not found. 
  Important Note: In sCampaignName any spaces in the string put in will be stripped. A string consisting of "Hello there" will become "Hellothere" (Note: Cases sensitive), and thus may cause problems when deleting databases (See Also DestroyCampaignDatabase). 
  There may also be a limit on the length of sCamapignName, although if anyone knows, please contact us.
remarks: |
  If an object is specified for oPlayer, it is possible to have more than one variable with the same name. However, it has not yet been rigourously tested, and it may be a good idea to use unique variable names anyway. 
  Moreover, database access in NWN is slow. It is a good idea to store variables locally, then transfer and read them to and from database only when you need to. 
  It is also important to remember that variables in the database are independent of the savegames. If a player goes back to a previous savegame, he'll still have all the latest variables in the database. While this is unlikely to actually help him, it can potentially corrupt the entire gaming experience for the player. 
  Thus, the real strength of the database is probably this: Ability to store variables in PWs on a regular basis, so a lot of information isn't lost (for instance, backup of variables can happen every hour or so). And it provides an easy way to transfer information between two or more modules, for instance in an official campaign type setting.
bugs: |
  There was a problem with storing player specific data in patch 1.30 (only Shadows of Undrentide, though). The fix in patch 1.31 would break compatibility between SoU 1.30 and SoU 1.31 player specific database access. 
  Not a bug, but a caveat: The database uses information about the player to store PC specific information. Thus, you can't use the PC as the oPlayer parameter in the database functions. This one is a little harder to work around. One thing you could perhaps do is ignore the oPlayer parameter, and then construct a variable name based on some of the info stored about the player OnClientEnter (see the workaround).
version: 1.62
example: |
  // Workaround for the caveat above
  void main()
  {
      object oPC=GetEnteringObject();
      string sPlayerName=GetPCPlayerName(oPC);
      string sIP=GetPCIPAddress(oPC);
      string sKey=GetPCPublicCDKey(oPC);
      SetLocalString(oPC, "player_name", sPlayerName);
      SetLocalString(oPC, "player_ip", sIP);
      SetLocalString(oPC, "player_cdkey", sKey);
  }
