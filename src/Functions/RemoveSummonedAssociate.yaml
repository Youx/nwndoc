description: |
  This function removes the "higher" abilities a PC has with summoned associates. (i.e. Heal me, Follow, etc.) The summoned associate is now set at Neutral to the PC, and it still disappears when PC rests.
remarks: |
  Aurora Toolset indicates associate will return to their original faction. 
  Summoned Associate will at times still follow PC, and at others go stationary and just turn to keep PC in sight. 
  Summoned associates removed from a PC and having neutral faction will still attack hostile creatures to PC.
