type: Function
name: ActionSpeakString
shortdesc: Causes an object to speak.
return: void
parameters:
  - type: string
    name: sStringToSpeak
    desc: | String to be spoken

  - type: int
    name: nTalkVolume
    default: TALKVOLUME_TALK
    desc: | TALKVOLUME_* (Default: TALKVOLUME_TALK)

description: |
  Adds to the caller's action queue an action that will cause the caller to speak sStringToSpeak. 
  nTalkVolume determines how loud the string will be spoken when the action is processed.
remarks: |
  This differs from SpeakString which causes the caller to speak immediately. Note that the caller must have an action queue for this to do anything (for example, triggers do not process actions). 
  See SpeakString for more information about talk volumes.
