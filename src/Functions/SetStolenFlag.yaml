type: Function
name: SetStolenFlag
shortdesc: Set whether the item is stolen
return: void
parameters:
  - type: object
    name: oItem
    desc: | Item to set flag on

  - type: int
    name: nStolenFlag
    desc: | TRUE or FALSE

description: |
  Sets whether this item is 'stolen' or not. 
  The stolen flag means only certain stores (with "Buys Stolen Goods" ticked) will buy the item, normally at a much lower amount.
remarks: |
  The stolen flag can be retrieved with GetStolenFlag(). 
  The stolen flag is set automatically on anything that is pickpocketed, and custom-made traps made with the Craft Trap skill are also set as stolen.
version: 1.62
example: |
  // Add to OnDisturbed for a chest.
  // Any item taken from this chest is stolen! Thieves beware...
  void main()
  {
      // Was an item taken or added?
      if(GetInventoryDisturbType() == INVENTORY_DISTURB_TYPE_REMOVED)
      {
          // Get item taken
          object oStolen = GetInventoryDisturbItem();
          // Check if the item is valid (or not...somehow)
          if(GetIsObjectValid(oStolen))
          {
              // Set it to stolen, they won't sell this easily!
              SetStolenFlag(oStolen, TRUE);
          }
      }
  }
