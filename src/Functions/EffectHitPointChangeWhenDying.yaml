type: Function
name: EffectHitPointChangeWhenDying
shortdesc: Returns a new effect object.
return: effect
parameters:
  - type: float
    name: fHitPointChangePerRound
    desc: | Positive or negative, but not zero.

description: |
  Create a Hit Point Change When Dying effect. 
  Returns an effect of type EFFECT_TYPE_INVALIDEFFECT if fHitPointChangePerRound is 0. 
  Fractions can be set; using -0.2 for fHitPointChangePerRound will mean that 1 HP is lost every 5 rounds. 
  A dying creature can still be conventionally damage - this is more useful if you wish to have a very simple OnDying event, which could apply this to do damage until they are dead (or recieve healing), using EffectHitPointChangeWhenDying(-1.0).
remarks: |
  Healing a character (or anything that makes HP go above 0) when a character is dying will cause the effect to automatically disappear. 
  Also note that a more conventional way to do bleeding would be to apply a cause of EffectDamage(), with a DelayCommand() wrappered around a function to apply a new one every 6 seconds.
bugs: |
  Trying to locate and destroy this effect is difficult because the effect type is 0 (along with knockdown and a few others). Healing will remove this effect.
version: 1.62
example: |
  // Sample code for applying a loss of 1 HP every 0.5 rounds, so
  // every other round, to a target
  void main()
  {
      // This is the Object to apply the effect to.
      object oTarget = OBJECT_SELF;
      // Create the effect to apply
      effect eHPLoss = EffectHitPointChangeWhenDying(-0.5);
      // Create the visual portion of the effect. This is instantly
      // applied and not persistant with wether or not we have the
      // above effect.
      effect eVis = EffectVisualEffect(VFX_IMP_VFX_IMP_HARM);
      // Apply the visual effect to the target
      ApplyEffectToObject(DURATION_TYPE_INSTANT, eVis, oTarget);
      // Apply the effect to the object   
      ApplyEffectToObject(DURATION_TYPE_PERMANENT, eHPLoss, oTarget);
