type: Function
name: ItemPropertyVisualEffect
shortdesc: Allows a melee weapon have a certain glow.
return: itemproperty
parameters:
  - type: int
    name: nEffect
    desc: | ITEM_VISUAL_*

description: |
  Sets a visual effect (ITEM_VISUAL_*) that may be applied to melee weapons only.
remarks: |
  Does not in any way effect the damage the weapon deals. The effect is purely visual, as the function name implies. 
  The itemproperty commands are special constructors - they construct an itemproperty "object" which can then be applied to an item using the AddItemProperty command, much like effects need to be first constructed, then applied with ApplyEffectToObject. 
  It will often be a good idea to remove similar itemproperties from the item first. There's a command in the "x2_inc_itemprop" include file called IPSafeAddItemProperty which will do that for you. Check IPSafeAddItemProperty for current bug report. 
  The ITEM_VISUAL_* value can be retrieved off this type of item property using GetItemPropertySubType.
version: 1.61
example: |
  #include "x2_inc_itemprop"
  //The include is for the IPSafeAddItemProperty function
  //Makes the PC speaker's onhand weapon glow electrically. Doesn't affect
  //the damage it deals, and it will only work on melee weapons
  void main()
  {
  object oPC = GetPCSpeaker();
  object oItem = GetItemInSlot(INVENTORY_SLOT_RIGHTHAND, oPC);
  if (!GetIsObjectValid(oItem)) return;
  itemproperty ipAdd = ItemPropertyVisualEffect(ITEM_VISUAL_ELECTRICAL);
  IPSafeAddItemProperty(oItem, ipAdd);
  }
