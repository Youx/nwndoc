shortdesc: Determines what type the object is.
return: int
parameters:

description: |
  Returns the object type (OBJECT_TYPE_*) of oTarget and 0 if oTarget is not a valid object.

  This function doesn't return -1 on error as it claims in the function's description in the Script Editor. Nor does it return OBJECT_TYPE_INVALID for invalid objects. Return value on error was, in my testing, always 0.
