type: Function
name: GetRacialType
shortdesc: Determines the race of a creature.
return: int
parameters:
  - type: object
    name: oCreature
    desc: | The creature whose race we are interested in.

description: |
  Returns the racial type (RACIAL_TYPE_*) of oCreature and RACIAL_TYPE_INVALID If oCreature is invalid.
remarks: |
  this is most useful, no, the best function, if only, for getting thier race. It mearly returns a value from the racialtypes.2da file, and so new races can be added in sucessfully. 
  This is widly used in most conversations, and places where race relations comes into play. Giving a special conversation option to cirtain races, and getting NPC's to react accordingly according to race, it usually a good way to add some depth to a world.
bugs: |
  1.64 makes sure that RACIAL_TYPE_INVALID is returned for any invalid object type when using this function.
version: 1.64
example: |
  // Area transition script
  // Dwarves go to "MORIA",
  // Everybody else goes to the default transition
  // (I know, stupid example, but still...)
  void main()
  {
      object oPC=GetClickingObject();
      object oTarget;
      if (GetRacialType(oPC)==RACIAL_TYPE_DWARF)
      {
          oTarget = GetObjectByTag("MORIA");
      }
      else
      {
          oTarget = GetTransitionTarget(OBJECT_SELF);
      }
      AssignCommand(oPC, JumpToObject(oTarget));
  }
