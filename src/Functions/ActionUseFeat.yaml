type: Function
name: ActionUseFeat
shortdesc: Causes an NPC to use a feat on oTarget.
return: void
parameters:
  - type: int
    name: nFeat
    desc: | FEAT_*

  - type: object
    name: oTarget
    desc: | The object to be the target of the Feat.

description: |
  ActionUseFeat causes the actor to use the specified feat on the target object (if appropriate). If the actor doesn't have the Feat, this action does nothing. 
  Only useable feats with a target can be used with this action. Feats such as Alertness, Martial Weapon Proficiency and so on cannot be used, of course.
remarks: |
  This action cannot be assigned to PCs. 
  There is no way to make an NPC use a feat it doesn't have, there is no "Cheat" option, however, the new IncrementRemainingFeatUses() allows constant use of a feat - if they started out by knowing it. 
  To remove feats, however, from being used, any useable ones can be decremented with DecrementRemainingFeatUses().
version: 1.61
example: |
  // In 'Actions Taken' script of conversation node from
  // an NPC with the 'Lay on Hands' feat:
  ActionUseFeat( FEAT_LAY_ON_HANDS, GetPCSpeaker() );
