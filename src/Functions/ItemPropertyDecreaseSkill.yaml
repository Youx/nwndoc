type: Function
name: ItemPropertyDecreaseSkill
shortdesc: Sets a decrease skill item property.
return: itemproperty
parameters:
  - type: int
    name: nSkill
    desc: | SKILL_*

  - type: int
    name: nPenalty
    desc: | Amount of ability to reduce skill; 1 to 10 are valid.

description: |
  Sets item property Decrease skill. You must specify the constant for the skill to be decreased (SKILL_*), such as Parry or Persuade, and the amount of the penalty. The penalty must be a POSITIVE integer between 1 and 10 (a value of 1 reduces the skill ability by 1).
remarks: |
  The itemproperty commands are special constructors - they construct an itemproperty "object" which can then be applied to an item using the AddItemProperty command, much like effects need to be first constructed, then applied with ApplyEffectToObject. 
  It will often be a good idea to remove similar itemproperties from the item first. There's a command in the "x2_inc_itemprop" include file called IPSafeAddItemProperty which will do that for you. Check IPSafeAddItemProperty for current bug report. 
  The SKILL_* constant can be retrieved off this type of item property using GetItemPropertySubType. The penalty can be retrieved using GetItemPropertCostTableValue.
version: 1.61
example: |
  #include "x2_inc_itemprop"
  //The include is for the IPSafeAddItemProperty function
  //Makes the PC speaker's helmet make the player really hard to hide
  void main()
  {
  object oPC=GetPCSpeaker();
  object oItem = GetItemInSlot(INVENTORY_SLOT_HEAD, oPC);
  if (!GetIsObjectValid(oItem)) return;
  itemproperty ipAdd = ItemPropertyDecreaseSkill(SKILL_HIDE, 10);
  IPSafeAddItemProperty(oItem, ipAdd);
  }
