description: |
  Pause the current conversation at the node in the conversation file which called this function from its Action Taken script.
remarks: |
  You must call this function with the caller having an empty action queue, otherwise it will have no effect. Use ClearAllActions() for this, if calling ActionPauseConversation() has no effect. 
  If you pause the conversation at a PC response node, the PC's choice will be highlighted until you call ActionResumeConversation(), the PC cancels the conversation, or the PC runs out of range.
