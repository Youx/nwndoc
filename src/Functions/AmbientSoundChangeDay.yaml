type: Function
name: AmbientSoundChangeDay
shortdesc: Changes the ambient daytime soundtrack of an area.
return: void
parameters:
  - type: object
    name: oArea
    desc: | The area whose soundscape you want to change.

  - type: int
    name: nTrack
    desc: | The reference of the ambient soundtrack to use.

description: |
  Change the ambient day track for oArea to nTrack, where nTrack is an integer reference to an ambient sound track.
remarks: |
  Ambient soundtracks are referenced in ambientmusic.2da, but those integers aren't exposed as constants. The files they refer to appear in the /music directory, as *.bmu files, which are just .mp3 files by another name. 
  This will also turn the ambient sounds back on if they have been turned off.
version: 1.61
example: |
  // A trigger's OnEvent script:
  void main() 
  {
       object oArea = GetArea(OBJECT_SELF);
       MusicBackgroundStop(oArea); // Shut the music up
       AmbientSoundChangeDay(oArea, 46); // al_an_lzrdflk1
       AmbientSoundChangeNight(oArea, 46); // al_an_lzrdflk1
       AmbientSoundPlay(oArea); // In case it's off
       AmbientSoundSetDayVolume(oArea, 100); // In case it's too quiet
       AmbientSoundSetNightVolume(oArea, 100); // In case it's too quiet
       // Start the music up again.
       DelayCommand(30.0, MusicBackgroundPlay(oArea));
  }
