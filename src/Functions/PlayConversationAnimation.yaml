  Great for making tavern scripts and other scripts, where you want it to look like two NPCs are talking.

version: 1.29
example: |
  //Paint a trigger around an NPC tagged "drunk_man"
  #include "nw_i0_2q4luskan"
  void main()
  {
  //Who is approaching the drunk?
  object oTarget=GetEnteringObject();
  //The drunk man in the middle of the trigger
  object oDrunk=GetObjectByTag("drunk_man");
  //Don't do this if the entering object is the drunk man
  if (oTarget==oDrunk) return;
  //Randomly pick one of three animations
  int nAnimation;
  switch (d3())
  {
  case 1: nAnimation=ANIMATION_LOOPING_TALK_LAUGHING; break;
  case 2: nAnimation=ANIMATION_LOOPING_PAUSE_DRUNK; break;
  case 3: nAnimation=ANIMATION_FIREFORGET_DRINK; break;
  }
  //Make oDrunk face oTarget and act like a drunkard.
