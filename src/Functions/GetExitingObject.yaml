return: object
parameters:
description: |
  Returns the object that last left the caller. This function works on triggers, areas of effect, modules, areas and encounters. 
  Return a value of OBJECT_INVALID on an error.
remarks: |
  For AOE's, when they are destroyed (End of Duration or DestroyObject()), the Exit event fires for all of the creatures within it, so it can remove effects done OnEnter - and, for the event, the OBJECT_SELF is still valid.
