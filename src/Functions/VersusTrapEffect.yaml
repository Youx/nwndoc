type: Function
name: VersusTrapEffect
shortdesc: Modifies an effect so that it only works against traps.
return: effect
parameters:
  - type: effect
    name: eEffect
    desc: | The effect you wish to modify.

description: |
  Set eEffect to be versus traps.
remarks: |
  Much like setting an effect to work only against a certain alignment (Protection From Evil, etc), this allows you to raise reflex saves, dexterity, search values for a character but only make it effective against traps. 
  It can, of course, increase disarm trap skills versus traps - but they are only valid for traps anyway. Anything that a trap will not take into effect is a useless effect (such as a strength increase).
version: 1.22
example: |
  // Add +10 search, versus traps only, to the entering object.
  void main()
  {
      // Get object
      object oEnterer = GetEnteringObject();
      // Delcare effect
      effect eSearch = EffectSkillIncrease(SKILL_SEARCH, 10);
      // Make it versus a trap
      eSearch = VersusTrapEffect(eSearch);
      // Apply it permamently
      ApplyEffectToObject(DURATION_TYPE_PERMANENT, eSearch, oEnterer);
  }
