description: |
  Sets item property Enhancement bonus. You need to specify the 
  enhancement bonus, which should be an integer between 1 and 20.
remarks: |
  Only melee weapons can have enhancement bonuses - neither ranged weapons nor ammunition can hold such an itemproperty. 
  The itemproperty commands are special constructors - they construct an itemproperty "object" which can then be applied to an item using the AddItemProperty command, much like effects need to be first constructed, then applied with ApplyEffectToObject. 
  It will often be a good idea to remove similar itemproperties from the item first. There's a command in the "x2_inc_itemprop" include file called IPSafeAddItemProperty which will do that for you. Check IPSafeAddItemProperty for current bug report. 
  The bonus can be retrieved off this type of item property using GetItemPropertyCostTableValue.
version: 1.62
example: |
  #include "x2_inc_itemprop"
  //The include is for the IPSafeAddItemProperty function
  //Gives the PC speaker's onhand weapon a +15 enhancement bonus
  void main()
  {
  object oPC=GetPCSpeaker();
  object oItem = GetItemInSlot(INVENTORY_SLOT_RIGHTHAND, oPC);
  if (!GetIsObjectValid(oItem)) return;
  itemproperty ipAdd = ItemPropertyEnhancementBonus(15);
  IPSafeAddItemProperty(oItem, ipAdd);
  }
