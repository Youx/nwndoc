type: Function
name: IntToFloat
shortdesc: This function converts an int to a float of the same value.
return: float
parameters:
  - type: int
    name: nInteger
    desc: | The integer to convert into a float.

description: |
  This function coverts an integer to a float of the same value, so that converting 123 to a float would yield 123.00.
remarks: |
  Since the internal size of a float (3.4028183957828877e+38) is larger than an integer (2147483647) there will be no precision loss in this conversion.
bugs: |
  Testing revealed that the least significant digit was being approximated in numbers approaching the Integer maximum (2147483647) and Minimum (-2147483647). 
  The results are as follows: 
  2147483647 = 2147483648.00 
  2147482647 = 2147482624.00 
  2147473647 = 2147473664.00 
  2147383647 = 2147383680.00 
  2146483647 = 2146483584.00 
  2137483647 = 2137483648.00 
  2047483647 = 2047483648.00 
  1147483647 = 1147483648.00 
  147483647 = 147483648.00 
  47483647 = 47483648.00 
  Note that since this occurs only with very large numbers being converted (Ten Million and Beyond) this should not be an issue with most scripts.

example: |
  // Convert the age of the PC who uses this object into a float value.
  // This is then the duration of a regeneration effect applied to the PC
  // Go oldies!
  void main()
  {
      // Declare who is clicking on us
      object oClicker = GetClickingObject();
      // Get thier age
      int nAge = GetAge(oClicker);
      // Convert to float, which can be used as some form of time
      float fAge = IntToFloat(nAge);
      // Heals 1HP each 1 second, for an amount of seconds equal to
      // the persons age
      effect eRegen = EffectRegenerate(5, 1.0);
      ApplyEffectToObject(DURATION_TYPE_TEMPORARY, eRegen, oClicker, fAge);
