name: GetIsAreaAboveGround
shortdesc: Determines whether an area is above ground or not.
return: int
parameters:
  - type: object
    name: oArea
    desc: | Area to determine whether is above ground

description: |
  Returns AREA_ABOVEGROUND if the area oArea is above ground, AREA_UNDERGROUND otherwise. 
  Returns AREA_INVALID on an error.
remarks: |
  The above/under-ground status of the area is set in the area's properties under the advanced tab. 
  AREA_ABOVEGROUND is declared as 1 in nwscript.nss, and AREA_UNDERGROUND as 0. So you could also say that the function returns TRUE if the area is aboveground, and FALSE otherwise.
