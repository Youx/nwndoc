description: |
  Returns the object that was lost in an OnUnAcquiredItem event. On error this function will return OBJECT_INVALID; this should generally not be possible as the event is triggered by an item, but if you trigger the event manually then be aware of this error.
version: 1.22
example: |
  // Finds the object that was last lost on an OnUnAcquiredItem event.
  void main()
  {
      object a = GetModuleItemLost();
      if(a == OBJECT_INVALID)
          SendMessageToPC(GetFirstPC(),"OOPS A CRASH ME THINKS");
      else
          SendMessageToPC(GetFirstPC(),GetTag(a));
  }
