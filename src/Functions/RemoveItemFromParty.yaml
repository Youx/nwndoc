name: RemoveItemFromParty
shortdesc: Removes the specified item from whichever member of the party has it.
return: void
parameters:
  - type: object
    name: oPC
    desc: | The character whose party will be checked.

  - type: string
    name: sItemTag
    desc: | The item to be found.

description: |
  Remove an item (tag sItemTag) from whichever member of the party containing oPC has it. 
  This function will only remove the first copy of the item it finds. 
  This function only checks PCs, not associates. 
  This function will destroy items marked with the plot flag.
remarks: |
  This function relies on GetItemPossessedByParty to find the item, as such it checks oPC first and then everybody else. 
  Also note that x0_i0_partywide is already included in x0_i0_common. So you will only need to include one, not both.
requirements: |
  #include "x0_i0_partywide"
version: 1.61
