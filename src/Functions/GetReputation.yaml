type: Function
name: GetReputation
shortdesc: Determines how one creature feels toward another creature.
return: int
parameters:
  - type: object
    name: oSource
    desc: | The creature (or object) is the subject of oTarget's feelings.

  - type: object
    name: oTarget
    desc: | The creature (or object) whose feelings we wish to know.

description: |
  Returns an integer between 0 and 100 (inclusive) that represents how oSource feels about oTarget. 
  Returns -1 if either oSource or oTarget is an invalid object.
remarks: |
  Interpretation of the values returned by this function: 
  0-10 means oSource is hostile to oTarget: oSource will attack oTarget on sight. 
  11-89 means oSource is neutral to oTarget: oSource won't attack oTarget, but won't defend it either. 
  90-100 means oSource is friendly to oTarget: oSource will anyone attacking oTarget.
bugs: |
  This must have had a bug in pre-1.64 patches. 1.64 reports that it had some crashes to do with invalid objects being oSource or oTarget, which have now been fixed.
version: 1.64
