description: |
  Returns the challenge rating of the target creature to determine how tough it is.

  Challenge ratings are stand alone. In other words, the value is not in comparison to anything, but rather a straight up value.

example: |
  // Example 1 - Get the challenge rating of the creature that last
  // attacked me (whatever creature this script is called by) and 
  // check it against my challenge rating to see if I should be 
  // worried or not.
  void main(){
    // Make sure script isn't misplace...will only work on creatures.
    if (GetObjectType(OBJECT_SELF) != OBJECT_TYPE_CREATURE) return;
    // Get the creature that last attacked me.
    object oCreature = GetLastAttacker(OBJECT_SELF);
    // Get out if it is not a creature (PC or mob)
    if (GetObjectType(oCreature) != OBJECT_TYPE_CREATURE) return;
    // Get the challenge rating of the creature.
    float fChallenge = GetChallengeRating(oCreature);
    // Get my challenge rating.
    float fMe = GetChallengeRating(OBJECT_SELF);
    // Just for fun...
    if (fMe <= fChallenge)
    {
      SpeakString("Ok, I'm scared!",TALKVOLUME_TALK);
    }
    else
    {
      SpeakString("I'm gonna whoop 'em good!",TALKVOLUME_TALK);
    }
