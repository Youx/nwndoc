type: Function
name: ItemPropertyLimitUseByClass
shortdesc: Sets an "only useable by class" itemproperty.
return: itemproperty
parameters:
  - type: int
    name: nClass
    desc: | IP_CONST_CLASS_*

description: |
  Sets item property Limit use by class. You must specify the class(es) who are able to use this item (IP_CONST_CLASS_*).
remarks: |
  The itemproperty commands are special constructors - they construct an itemproperty "object" which can then be applied to an item using the AddItemProperty command, much like effects need to be first constructed, then applied with ApplyEffectToObject. 
  It will often be a good idea to remove similar itemproperties from the item first, unless you are stacking classes. There's a command in the "x2_inc_itemprop" include file called IPSafeAddItemProperty which will do that for you. Check IPSafeAddItemProperty for current bug report. 
  The IP_CONST_CLASS_* value can be retrieved off this type of item property using GetItemPropertySubType.
version: 1.61
example: |
  #include "x2_inc_itemprop"
  //The include is for the IPSafeAddItemProperty function
  //Restricts the use of the PC speaker's weapon so that
  //only those of the same class can use it.
  //The class is determined as the first of the PC's three
  //classes that isn't a prestige class.
  void main()
  {
  object oPC = GetPCSpeaker();
  object oItem = GetItemInSlot(INVENTORY_SLOT_RIGHTHAND, oPC);
  if (!GetIsObjectValid(oItem)) return; //stop if nothing there
  int nClass;
  int nCount = 1;
  do
  {   nClass = GetLevelByClass(nCount);
      nCount++;
  }
  while (nClass>10); //loops through prestige classes
  //The integer value for the standard PC classes
  //(not prestige classes) are the same for CLASS_TYPE_*
  //as for IP_CONST_CLASS_*, and are thus interchangeable.
  //See comments under ItemPropertyLimitUseByAlign - ed.
  itemproperty ipAdd = ItemPropertyLimitUseByClass(nClass);
  IPSafeAddItemProperty(oItem, ipAdd);
  //Note: if adding more classes, use AddItemProperty - ed.
