  Doesn’t do anything.
remarks: |
  nw_i0_generic.nss: 144 
  This function’s contents have been commented out, which leads me to believe that this function was used in debugging (indeed, it is called several times from within the nw_i0_generic script). Before it was commented out, all it did was write an entry into the log including the id of tTalent.
