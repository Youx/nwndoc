description: |
  Sets item property Attack bonus. You must specify an attack bonus, which should be an integer between 1 and 20.
remarks: |
  The itemproperty commands are special constructors - they construct an itemproperty "object" which can then be applied to an item using the AddItemProperty command, much like effects need to be first constructed, then applied with ApplyEffectToObject. 
  It will often be a good idea to remove similar itemproperties from the item first. There's a command in the "x2_inc_itemprop" include file called IPSafeAddItemProperty which will do that for you. Check IPSafeAddItemProperty for current bug report. 
  The bonus can be retrieved off this type of item property using GetItemPropertyCostTableValue.
version: 1.61
example: |
  #include "x2_inc_itemprop"
  //The include is for the IPSafeAddItemProperty function
  //Grants the PC speaker's onhand weapon a +10 attack bonus
  void main()
  {
  object oPC = GetPCSpeaker();
  object oItem = GetItemInSlot(INVENTORY_SLOT_RIGHTHAND, oPC);
  if (!GetIsObjectValid(oItem)) return; // Stop if nothing equipped
  itemproperty ipAdd = ItemPropertyAttackBonus(10);
  IPSafeAddItemProperty(oItem, ipAdd);
  }
