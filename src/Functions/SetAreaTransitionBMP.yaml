type: Function
name: SetAreaTransitionBMP
shortdesc: Sets the graphic shown when a PC moves between two different areas in a module.
return: void
parameters:
  - type: int
    name: nPredefinedAreaTransition
    desc: | AREA_TRANSITION_*

  - type: string
    name: sCustomAreaTransitionBMP
    default: ""
    desc: | File name of an area transition bitmap. (Default: "")

description: |
  Sets the area transition bitmap; this is only useful in OnAreaTransitionClick scripts. This action should be run by the person "clicking" the area transition via AssignCommand. 
  To use a predefined area transition bitmap, use one of AREA_TRANSITION_* 
  To use a custom, user-defined area transition bitmap, use AREA_TRANSITION_USER_DEFINED and specify the filename in the second parameter.
remarks: |
  Even though the script "nw_g0_transition" uses it, it actually uses it incorrectly so you never get a random transition BMP. The correct use would be that in the code sample. 
  It is most likely this command only works once per transition, and so is tempoary, as there is no default AREA_TRANSITION_* constant.
version: 1.22
example: |
  // This will use the wizard-set target object to move to, similar to the file "nw_g0_transition"
  // It will always show the 1st crypt transition BMP, however!
  void main()
  {
      // Declare who is moving, and the target.
      object oClicker = GetClickingObject();
      object oTarget = GetTransitionTarget(OBJECT_SELF);
      // Make them show the crypt BMP for the area transition
      AssignCommand(oClicker, SetAreaTransitionBMP(AREA_TRANSITION_CRYPT));
      // Move them to the target
      AssignCommand(oClicker, JumpToObject(oTarget));
  }
