type: Function
name: ItemPropertyAttackBonusVsSAlign
shortdesc: Sets an "attack bonus versus specific alignment" itemproperty.
return: itemproperty
parameters:
  - type: int
    name: nAlignment
    desc: | IP_CONST_ALIGNMENT_*

  - type: int
    name: nBonus
    desc: | Attack bonus; 1 to 20 are valid.

description: |
  Sets item property Attack bonus vs. a specific alignment, such as Lawful Evil. You must specify the alignment you want the bonus to work against (IP_CONST_ALIGNMENT_*) and the attack bonus, which should be an integer between 1 and 20.
remarks: |
  The itemproperty commands are special constructors - they construct an itemproperty "object" which can then be applied to an item using the AddItemProperty command, much like effects need to be first constructed, then applied with ApplyEffectToObject. 
  It will often be a good idea to remove similar itemproperties from the item first. There's a command in the "x2_inc_itemprop" include file called IPSafeAddItemProperty which will do that for you. Check IPSafeAddItemProperty for current bug report. 
  The IP_CONST_ALIGNMENT_* constant can be retrieved off this type of item property using GetItemPropertySubType. The bonus can be retrieved using GetItemPropertCostTableValue.
version: 1.61
example: |
  #include "x2_inc_itemprop"
  //The include is for the IPSafeAddItemProperty function
  //Grants the PC speaker's onhand weapon a +10 attack bonus against lawful good
  void main()
  {
  object oPC = GetPCSpeaker();
  object oItem = GetItemInSlot(INVENTORY_SLOT_RIGHTHAND, oPC);
  if (!GetIsObjectValid(oItem)) return;
  itemproperty ipAdd = ItemPropertyAttackBonusVsSAlign(IP_CONST_ALIGNMENT_LG, 10);
  IPSafeAddItemProperty(oItem, ipAdd);
  }
