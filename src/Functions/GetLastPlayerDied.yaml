example: |
  // From Bioware's David Gaider Scripting FAQ
  // I'm creating a custom 'ClearAll FactionMembers' command, here
  // first declaring the api for the new command, then what it does
  // I could reasonably have put this in a seperate script and
  // used #include to put it into this script (and others), as well
  void ClearAllFactionMembers (object oMember, object oPlayer)
  {
      object oClear = GetFirstFactionMember (oMember, FALSE);
      while (GetIsObjectValid(oClear) == TRUE)
      {
          ClearPersonalReputation (oPlayer, oClear);
          oClear = GetNextFactionMember (oMember, FALSE);
      }
  }
  // here's the main body of my script
  void main()
  {
      // identify the player
      object oPlayer = GetLastPlayerDied();
      // identify a member of the faction. I'm assuming these members are alive.
      // Otherwise, I would have to try several things to turn up a member that is
      // first valid and then do the if command
      object oGoblin = GetObjectByTag("GOBLIN1");
      if (GetIsObjectValid(oGoblin))
      {
          // adjust the faction relation back up by 100
          AdjustReputation (oPlayer, oGoblin, 100);
          // run my custom command to cycle through the faction
          ClearAllFactionMembers (oGoblin, oPlayer);
      }
  }
