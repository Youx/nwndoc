remarks: |
  Function can be found in nw_j_story.nss on line 146. 
  It seems this set of functions are centered around storing plot item related information on NPCs for simple fetch related quests. This particular function only utilizes 2 out of the 7 other functions available. All of these functions are relatively straight forward and easy to understand at a glance. There are two other sets very much similiar to this one where the only difference is in the function naming scheme. See the "See Also" for links.

  You'll probably never need to call this function in normal scripting, since it is very specific to BioWare's plot handling system.
