description: |
  Returns the last player to cancel a cut-scene.
remarks: |
  This function should only be used in the OnCutsceneAbort event, which will fire when a player who is in a cutscene (set by SetCutsceneMode) hits the escape button. The player who hit that button is then returned by this function. 
  Note that the abort of the cutscene must be scripted manually into the OnCutsceneAbort event - simply pressing escape won't even take the PC out of SetCutsceneMode if you don't put that in the script.
