shortdesc: Returns location directly behind the target and facing same direction as the target
return: location
parameters:
  - type: object
    name: oTarget
    desc: | Target to get behind

description: |
  Returns location directly behind the target and facing same direction as the target (useful for backstabbing attacks). 
  Calls 
  float GetFacing(object oTarget) 
  float GetOppositeDirection(float fDir) 
  location GenerateNewLocation(object oTarget, float DISTANCE_MEDIUM, float fAngleToRightFlank, float fDir) 
remarks: |
  This function is functionally the same as 
  location GetOppositeLocation(object oTarget) 
  The only difference being that GetOppositeLocation calls GenerateNewLocation(oTarget, DISTANCE_MEDIUM, fDir, fAngleOpposite) 
  And GetBehindLocation calls 
  GenerateNewLocation(oTarget, DISTANCE_MEDIUM, fAngleOpposite, fDir);
