type: Function
name: SetCalendar
shortdesc: Set calendar date for the module.
return: void
parameters:
  - type: int
    name: nYear
    desc: | Specific year to set calendar to from 1340 to 32001.

  - type: int
    name: nMonth
    desc: | Specific month to set calendar from 1 to 12.

  - type: int
    name: nDay
    desc: | Specific day to set calendar to from 1 to 28.

description: |
  Sets the current year, month and day for the module.
remarks: |
  If values larger than the month or day are specified, they will be wrapped around and the overflow will be used to advance the next field. e.g. Specifying a year of 1350, month of 33 and day of 10 will result in the calender being set to a year of 1352, a month of 9 and a day of 10.
bugs: |
  There is still a bug with advancing the time when setting the month to higher than 13, though it doesnâ€™t always set the month to 12. 
  The previously noted bug about not being able to set the year to before 1340 has been fixed a while ago.
