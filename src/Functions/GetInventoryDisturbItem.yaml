  Returns OBJECT_INVALID on error, which will never happen if this function is used exclusively in OnDisturbed events of objects with inventories. (At least in theory - check the bug list below)
bugs: |
  It has been previously noted that the event OnDisturbed does not fire when the item being disturbed is gold. There’s still something odd going on with that function. I made this little script and put OnDisturbed of a container: 
  void main() 
  { 
  object oPC=GetLastDisturbed(); 
  object oDisturb=GetInventoryDisturbItem(); 
  SendMessageToPC(oPC, "this: "+GetName(oDisturb)); 
  } 
  When I put gold into the container, I get a message telling me “this: Gold piece”. So it does fire for gold. When I take it back from the container, I get the message “this:” 
  I tested it, and when removing gold from a container, GetInventoryDisturbItem() returns OBJECT_INVALID. 
  Also, there’s a bug with stackable items. If a stackable item is added to another stack in either the givers or receivers inventory, the OnDisturbed event never fires (except for gold pieces, apparently).

  void main()

       switch (nType)
       {
       case INVENTORY_DISTURB_TYPE_REMOVED:
       case INVENTORY_DISTURB_TYPE_STOLEN:
           int nAmount=GetGoldPieceValue(oItem);
           AssignCommand(oPC, TakeGoldFromCreature(nAmount, oPC, TRUE));
           SendMessageToPC(oPC, "Stealing is wrong. Give me your money!");
           break;
      }
  }
