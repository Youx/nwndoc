type: Function
name: SetWeather
shortdesc: Allows you to set the weather for an area or the entire module.
return: void
parameters:
  - type: object
    name: oTarget
    desc: | If this is GetModule(), all outdoor areas will be modified by the weather constant. If it is an area, oTarget will play the weather only if it is an outdoor area.

  - type: int
    name: nWeather
    desc: | WEATHER_*

description: |
  Set the weather for oTarget. 
  - WEATHER_USE_AREA_SETTINGS will set the area back to whatever weather the area had set in the toolset. 
  - WEATHER_CLEAR, WEATHER_RAIN, WEATHER_SNOW will make the weather go to the appropriate precipitation *without stopping*.
remarks: |
  As of patch 1.31, BioWare has provided us with a GetWeather function, making it a lot easier to manipulate weather. Module builders not using patch 1.31 (or newer) will have to keep track of weather in areas manually.
bugs: |
  When changing the weather from WEATHER_RAIN to WEATHER_SNOW, the lightning weather effect continues to occur. Go from WEATHER_RAIN to WEATHER_CLEAR to WEATHER_SNOW to avoid this unnatural phenomenon.
version: 1.61
example: |
  // script to make it snow (module wide) 
  void main()
  {
      object oModule = GetModule();
      SetWeather(oModule, WEATHER_SNOW);
  }
