type: Function
name: GetIsAreaNatural
shortdesc: Returns whether an area is natural or not
return: int
parameters:
  - type: object
    name: oArea
    desc: | Area to test whether is natural

description: |
  Returns AREA_NATURAL if the area oArea is natural, AREA_ARTIFICIAL otherwise. 
  Returns AREA_INVALID, on an error.
remarks: |
  The natural / artificial status of the area is set in the area's properties under the advanced tab. 
  AREA_NATURAL is declared as 1 in nwscript.nss, and AREA_ARTIFICIAL as 0. So you could also say that the function returns TRUE if the area is natural, and FALSE otherwise.
