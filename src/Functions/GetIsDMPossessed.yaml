name: GetIsDMPossessed
shortdesc: Returns whether the creature is possessed by a DM
return: int

  - type: object
    name: oCreature
    desc: | Creature to check whether is possessed

description: |
  Returns TRUE if the creature oCreature is currently possessed by a DM character. 
  Returns FALSE otherwise. 
  Note: GetIsDMPossessed() will return FALSE if oCreature is the DM character. 
  To determine if oCreature is a DM character use GetIsDM()
remarks: |
  This function appears to do the same as this: 
  GetIsDM(GetMaster(oCreature)); 
  If you know of any differences between the two, the Lexicon's authors would love to hear from you :)
