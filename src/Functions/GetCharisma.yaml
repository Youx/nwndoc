shortdesc: Gets the targets Charisma Ability Score.
return: int
parameters:
  - type: object
    name: oTarget

description: |
  Returns the Charisma Ability value of oTarget.
remarks: |
  Function can be found in nw_i0_plot.nss on line 758. 
  Very simple function, probably created so the scripters did not have to type out the full call to GetAbilityScore() each time they used it. This merely calls the GetAbilityScore(oTarget, ABILITY_CHARISMA) function in that manner.
