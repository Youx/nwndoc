description: |
  In theory, this function should make the caller (henchman) open the nearest locked, if able.
remarks: |
  Found in nw_i0_assoc.nss line 24 
  Due to an error in the include file this is in, you can never use this include file, including this function. You could copy it into a different script, though.
