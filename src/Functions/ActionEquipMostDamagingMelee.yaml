type: Function
name: ActionEquipMostDamagingMelee
shortdesc: Causes the calling creature to equip its most damaging weapon.
return: void
parameters:
  - type: object
    name: oVersus
    default: OBJECT_INVALID
    desc: | Object used to determine the most damaging weapon against. (Default: OBJECT_INVALID)

  - type: int
    name: bOffHand
    default: FALSE
    desc: | Determines if an off-hand weapon is equipped. (Default: FALSE)

description: |
  The creature will equip the melee weapon in its possession that can do the most damage (specifically against oVersus, if it is not OBJECT_INVALID). If no valid melee weapon is found, it will equip the most damaging ranged weapon. 
  This only takes into account the enchantment bonuses of the weapon - anything such as improved damage, or attack bonuses, seem to be ignored.
remarks: |
  This function should only ever be called in the EndOfCombatRound (the onCombatRoundEnd script, or uncomment the line with NW_FLAG_END_COMBAT_ROUND_EVENT in the onSpawn script and use the onUserDefined script) scripts, because otherwise it would have to stop the combat round to run simulation. 
  As with all ActionEquip* functions, it is not necessary to first unequip the current item in the same inventory slot before equipping the new item. 
  This doesn't take into account shields (or lack thereof) and will never equip one, only unequip one if they use a two handed weapon.

example: |
  // When we see a PC, we equip our best melee weapon
  // and go "grrr" - 'cause we're an orc, or something, of course.
  // * Use the User Defined Event for perception
  void main()
  {
      // User event 1002 is the Perception event.
      if(GetUserDefinedEvent() == 1002)
      {
          // Make sure we are not in combat and we only do it once
          if(GetLocalInt(OBJECT_SELF, "EQUIPPED") == FALSE &&
            !GetIsInCombat(OBJECT_SELF))
          {
              // We equip the weapon if the perceieved object is a PC
              if(GetIsPC(GetLastPercieved())
              {
                  // Speak the string, equip, set to not do it again
                  ClearAllActions();
                  SpeakString("Grrrrr");
                  ActionEquipMostDamagingMelee();
                  SetLocalInt(OBJECT_SELF, "EQUIPPED", TRUE);
                  return;
              }
          }
      }
