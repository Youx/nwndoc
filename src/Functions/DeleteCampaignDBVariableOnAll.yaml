description: |
  Given a PC and a variable name, deletes all campaign database variables of that name from the Player Characters in the PC's party. 
remarks: |
  Does not apply to associates. 
  Include library for party-wide functions. 
  NOTE: this library is included in "x0_i0_common" already. 
  Do NOT dual-include both files or you will get errors! 
  [This should be the definitive answer to whether or not different names should be used for different variable types for local and campaign variables - you are safer using exclusive variable names.]
