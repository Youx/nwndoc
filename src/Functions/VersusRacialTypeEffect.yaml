name: VersusRacialTypeEffect
shortdesc: Set eEffect to be versus nRacialType.
return: effect
parameters:
  - type: effect
    name: eEffect
    desc: | nRacialType

  - type: int
    name: nRacialType
description: |
  Returns an effect modified in such a way as to be versus a specific race of creature only. Uses the RACIAL_TYPE_ constants to define the race to use.
remarks: |
  This is a pretty handy function when creating spell effects or special items to be used against (or by) a certain race of creature. Notice that it expects the RACIAL_TYPE_ constants as a parameter. If you wanted it to affect Elves only, you would set the parameter to RACIAL_TYPE_ELF. If you wanted it to affect all Giant type creatures, you set the parameter to RACIAL_TYPE_GIANT.
version: 1.22
example: |
  // A sword that does extra damage effect against dragons only.
  void main(){
  	effect eBonusToApply = EffectDamageIncrease(20, DAMAGE_TYPE_MAGICAL);
  	eBonusToApply = VersusRacialTypeEffect(eBonusToApply, RACIAL_TYPE_DRAGON);
  	object oTargetOfSpell = GetSpellTargetObject();
  	ApplyEffectToObject(DURATION_TYPE_INSTANT, eBonusToApply, oTargetOfSpell);
  }
