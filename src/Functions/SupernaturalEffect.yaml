type: Function
name: SupernaturalEffect
shortdesc: Modifies an effect to make it a Supernatural effect.
return: effect
parameters:
  - type: effect
    name: eEffect
    desc: | An effect to categorise as being SUBTYPE_SUPERNATURAL.

description: |
  Sets the subtype of eEffect to SUBTYPE_SUPERNATURAL and returns the modified eEffect, now a Supernatural effect. This allows the engine to apply the effect with the same rules as Supernatural Abilities (3rd edition DMG page 71, MM page 7). 
  Permanent supernatural effects aren't removed by resting, and cannot be dispelled if applied from a spell script. 
  If you put a link of effects as eEffect, then the entire link and all the effects within it are made supernatural. 
  You cannot change exsisting effect's subtypes with this function, only ones you have created via. the "effect" declaration.
remarks: |
  The extent to which the Aurora Engine follows the 3rd Edition rules for Supernatural effects and abilities are not fully measured. 
  However, tests by me (Jasperre) am definatly sure any supernatural effects are: 
  - Undispellable 
  - Cannot be removed by resting 
  Permament monster abilities will be Supernatural, especially ones used on other beings, such as Curses, Ability Drain and Level Drain. 
  Magical effects can be dispelled and removed by resting, and extraodinary effects can only be removed by resting.
version: 1.61
example: |
  // Decrease entering PC's strength by 1 as a supernatural effect.
  void main()
  {
      object oPC=GetEnteringObject();
      if(!GetIsPC(oPC)) return;
      effect eBad=EffectAbilityDecrease(ABILITY_STRENGTH, 1);
      eBad=SupernaturalEffect(eBad);
      ApplyEffectToObject(DURATION_TYPE_PERMANENT, eBad, oPC);
