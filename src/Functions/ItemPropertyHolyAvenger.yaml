type: Function
name: ItemPropertyHolyAvenger
shortdesc: Sets a holy avenger itemproperty.
return: itemproperty
parameters:
description: |
  Sets item property Holy Avenger, which, when added to a weapon, enhances it according to the alignment of its user.
remarks: |
  The itemproperty commands are special constructors - they construct an itemproperty "object" which can then be applied to an item using the AddItemProperty command, much like effects need to be first constructed, then applied with ApplyEffectToObject. 
  It will often be a good idea to remove similar itemproperties from the item first. There's a command in the "x2_inc_itemprop" include file called IPSafeAddItemProperty which will do that for you. Check IPSafeAddItemProperty for current bug report.
version: 1.61
example: |
  #include "x2_inc_itemprop"
  //The include is for the IPSafeAddItemProperty function
  //Gives the first PC's onhand weapon the holy avenger property
  void main()
  {
  object oPC=GetFirstPC();
  object oItem = GetItemInSlot(INVENTORY_SLOT_RIGHTHAND, oPC);
  if (!GetIsObjectValid(oItem)) return;
  itemproperty ipAdd = ItemPropertyHolyAvenger();
  IPSafeAddItemProperty(oItem, ipAdd);
  }
