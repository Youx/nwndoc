description: |
  Determines if a creature is immortal; that is will not die no matter what.
remarks: |
  Immortal creatures take damage, but can never be killed. Personally, I'd consider it bad form to use these too much, and never without giving the PC a clue that they might not be able to kill this particular monster. Nothing is more annoying than struggling to get a creature to near death, and then fighting it for ten more minutes before you get up, since the creature could actually never be killed.
