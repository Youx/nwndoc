type: Function
name: ItemPropertyTurnResistance
shortdesc: Sets a turn resistance itemproperty.
return: itemproperty
parameters:
  - type: int
    name: nModifier
    desc: | Turn resistance bonus to add; 1 to 50 are valid.

description: |
  Sets item property Turn resistance. You must specify the resistance bonus, which should be an integer between 1 and 50.
remarks: |
  The itemproperty commands are special constructors - they construct an itemproperty "object" which can then be applied to an item using the AddItemProperty command, much like effects need to be first constructed, then applied with ApplyEffectToObject. 
  It will often be a good idea to remove similar itemproperties from the item first. There's a command in the "x2_inc_itemprop" include file called IPSafeAddItemProperty which will do that for you. Check IPSafeAddItemProperty for current bug report. 
  The bonus can be retrieved off this type of item property using GetItemPropertyCostTableValue.
version: 1.61
example: |
  #include "x2_inc_itemprop"
  //The include is for the IPSafeAddItemProperty function
  //Makes the PC speaker's amulet grant 50 turn resistance
  void main()
  {
  object oPC = GetPCSpeaker();
  object oItem = GetItemInSlot(INVENTORY_SLOT_NECK, oPC);
  if (!GetIsObjectValid(oItem)) return;
  itemproperty ipAdd = ItemPropertyTurnResistance(50);
  IPSafeAddItemProperty(oItem, ipAdd);
  }
