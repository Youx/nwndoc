type: Function
name: SendMessageToPCByStrRef
shortdesc: Send a message to a player
return: void
parameters:
  - type: object
    name: oPlayer
    desc: | Player to send message to

  - type: int
    name: nStrRef
    desc: | StrRef of the message to send

description: |
  Send a server message (szMessage) to the oPlayer.
remarks: |
  The StrRef is an index number into the user's dialog.tlk file, which is a language specific file. Since Hordes of the Underdark, it's become possible to easily make your own tlk file and include with your module. Note that you must add 16777216 to the index in your file, so if you want entry 1 in your custom tlk file, you'll need use 16777217 for the nStrRef in this function.
