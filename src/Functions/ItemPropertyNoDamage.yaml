type: Function
name: ItemPropertyNoDamage
shortdesc: Sets a no damage itemproperty.
return: itemproperty
parameters:
description: |
  Sets item property No damage. This means the weapon will do no damage in combat.
remarks: |
  Useful for making weapons that are powerful in other ways, like special OnHit itemproperties, without making them too overpowering. 
  The itemproperty commands are special constructors - they construct an itemproperty "object" which can then be applied to an item using the AddItemProperty command, much like effects need to be first constructed, then applied with ApplyEffectToObject. 
  It will often be a good idea to remove similar itemproperties from the item first. There's a command in the "x2_inc_itemprop" include file called IPSafeAddItemProperty which will do that for you. Check IPSafeAddItemProperty for current bug report.

version: 1.61
example: |
  #include "x2_inc_itemprop"
  //The include is for the IPSafeAddItemProperty function
  //Makes the PC speaker's onhand weapon deal no combat damage
  void main()
  {
  object oPC = GetPCSpeaker();
  object oItem = GetItemInSlot(INVENTORY_SLOT_RIGHTHAND, oPC);
  if (!GetIsObjectValid(oItem)) return;
  itemproperty ipAdd = ItemPropertyNoDamage();
  IPSafeAddItemProperty(oItem, ipAdd);
  }
