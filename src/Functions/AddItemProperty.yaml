description: |
  Adds an item property to the specified item. 
  Only temporary and permanent duration types are allowed.
remarks: |
  The itemproperty must first be created using one of the many ItemProperty functions. In this respect, it works much like effects, which must first be created, then applied. 
  It will often be a good idea to remove similar itemproperties from the item first. There's a command in the "x2_inc_itemprop" include file called IPSafeAddItemProperty which will do that for you.
version: 1.61
example: |
  //Have the NPC upgrade the PC speaker's helmet to a
  //HELMET OF UNDEAD TURNING
  void main()
  {
  object oPC=GetPCSpeaker();
  object oHelmet=GetItemInSlot(INVENTORY_SLOT_HEAD, oPC);
  if (!GetIsObjectValid(oHelmet)) return;
  itemproperty ipAddFeat=ItemPropertyBonusFeat(FEAT_TURN_UNDEAD);
  AddItemProperty(DURATION_TYPE_PERMANENT, ipAddFeat, oHelmet);
  }
