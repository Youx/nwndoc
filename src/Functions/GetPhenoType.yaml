return: int
parameters:

    name: oCreature
    desc: | The creature to check the phenotype of

description: |
  This will return the creature's currently set PhenoType (body type). 
  The valid constants are PHENOTYPE_BIG, PHENOTYPE_NORMAL, and PHENOTYPE_CUSTOM.
remarks: |
  Note that a phenotype is only valid for the default 7 PC races (Dwarf, Human, Half Elf, Half Orc, Elf, Gnome and Halfling). 
  It is basically the "Fat/Thin" option given when you create your character, however, custom content creators can have a better and more varied use for it as there will no doubt be.
version: 1.64
example: |
  // If the PC's phenotype is big, we comment on it, in a conversation
  void main()
  {
      // PC speaker
      object oPC = GetPCSpeaker();
      if(GetPhenoType(oPC) == PHENOTYPE_BIG)
      {
          // Comment on it dramatically and respectfully, as a Halfling might
          SpeakString("oooh, we got a well-fed kind of a person here, ain't we!");
      }
  }
