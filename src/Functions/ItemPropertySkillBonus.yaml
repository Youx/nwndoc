description: |
  Sets item property Skill bonus. You must specify the skill to which the user will get a bonus(SKILL_*) and the amount of the bonus, which should be an integer between 1 and 50.
remarks: |
  The itemproperty commands are special constructors - they construct an itemproperty "object" which can then be applied to an item using the AddItemProperty command, much like effects need to be first constructed, then applied with ApplyEffectToObject. 
  It will often be a good idea to remove similar itemproperties from the item first. There's a command in the "x2_inc_itemprop" include file called IPSafeAddItemProperty which will do that for you. Check IPSafeAddItemProperty for current bug report. 
  The SKILL_* constant can be retrieved off this type of item property using GetItemPropertySubType. The bonus can be retrieved using GetItemPropertCostTableValue.
version: 1.61
example: |
  #include "x2_inc_itemprop"
  //The include is for the IPSafeAddItemProperty function
  //Makes the PC speaker's helmet grant a concentration bonus of 30
  void main()
  {
  object oPC = GetPCSpeaker();
  object oItem = GetItemInSlot(INVENTORY_SLOT_HEAD, oPC);
  if (!GetIsObjectValid(oItem)) return;// Stop if no helmet
  itemproperty ipAdd = ItemPropertySkillBonus(SKILL_CONCENTRATION, 30);
  IPSafeAddItemProperty(oItem, ipAdd);
  }
