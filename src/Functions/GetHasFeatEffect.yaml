type: Function
name: GetHasFeatEffect
shortdesc: Determines whether a creature has the effects of a feat.
return: int
parameters:
  - type: int
    name: nFeat
    desc: | FEAT_*

  - type: object
    name: oObject
    default: OBJECT_SELF
    desc: | The object to investigate. (Default: OBJECT_SELF)

description: |
  Returns TRUE if oObject has effects on it originating from nFeat, otherwise FALSE. 
  Of course, oObject should almost always be a creature to get an accurate result.
remarks: |
  This should return TRUE even if the feat applies spell-like effects (such as Barbarian Rage, which has a "spell" attached to it, to apply effects), although it cirtainly accuratly reports when such feats as Knockdown are applied to a target.
