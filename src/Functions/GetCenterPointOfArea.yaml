type: Function
name: GetCenterPointOfArea
shortdesc: Approximates the central location of an area.
return: location
parameters:
  - type: object
    name: oArea
    desc: | Area to get center point of

description: |
  Get the (roughly) center point of an area. 
  This works by going through all the objects in an area and getting their positions, so it is resource-intensive.
remarks: |
  Not a function anybody would want to use, except perhaps for some debugging / testing. If you really need the central location of an area, I suggest you just create it yourself based on the size of the area. Assuming you store the size of all areas in two local floats on each area, called x and y, you can use the function I've written below instead.
version: 1.61
example: |
  //Resource light version of this function. Requires the size
  //of the area to be stored as local floats on the area called x and y
  location GetCentralLocation(object oArea)
  {
  float fX=GetLocalFloat(oArea, "x");
  float fY=GetLocalFloat(oArea, "y");
  vector vCenter=Vector(fX/2.0, fY/2.0, 0.0);
  return Location(oArea, vCenter, 0.0);
  }
