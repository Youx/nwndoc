type: Function
name: ActionForceMoveToObject
shortdesc: Attempts to move an NPC to a certain distance of a target object even if a clear path doesn't exist.
return: void
parameters:
  - type: object
    name: oMoveTo
    desc: | Target object to move to.

  - type: int
    name: bRun
    default: FALSE
    desc: | Run boolean. TRUE: subject will run to oMoveTo. (Default: FALSE)

  - type: float
    name: fRange
    default: 1.0f
    desc: | The range from oMoveTo to stop at. (Default: 1.0f)

  - type: float
    name: fTimeout
    default: 30.0f
    desc: | Amount of time to search for path before jumping to the object (as in ActionJumpToObject). (Default: 30.0f)

description: |
  The action subject will attempt to move to within fRange meters of oMoveTo. The creature will try for fTimeout seconds to reach the waypoint and will teleport to the location no matter if it found a path in the meantime or not. 
  No return value, but if an error occurs the log file will contain "MoveToPoint failed."
remarks: |
  Move to object functions (ActionForceMoveToObject, ActionMoveToObject) actually do path finding, unlike their move to location (ActionForceMoveToLocation, ActionMoveToLocation) counterparts.
