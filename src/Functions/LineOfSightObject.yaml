type: Function
name: LineOfSightObject
shortdesc: Is there a line of sight between two objects
return: int
parameters:
  - type: object
    name: oSource
    desc: | Source object

  - type: object
    name: oTarget
    desc: | Target object

description: |
  Returns whether or not there is a direct line of sight between the two objects. (Not blocked by any geometry). 
  PLEASE NOTE: This is an expensive function and may degrade performance if used frequently.
remarks: |
  With this function came a fix to GetFirst/NextObjectInShape, and makes sure fireballs do not go through walls or doors. 
  This is hardly ever needed practically - for spell scripts, it is not required unless an area-of-effect spell doesn't use GetFirst/NextObjectInShape, because the game already has internal restraints on Line-Of-Sight checks.
version: 1.61
example: |
  //Can I see bob?
  void main()
  {
  object oTarget=GetObjectByTag("bob");
  int bCanISee=LineOfSightObject(OBJECT_SELF, oTarget);
  }
