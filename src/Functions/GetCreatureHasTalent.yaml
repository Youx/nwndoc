type: Function
name: GetCreatureHasTalent
shortdesc: Determines whether a creature has a specific talent.
return: int
parameters:
  - type: talent
    name: tTalent
    desc: | The talent which will be checked for on the given creature.

  - type: object
    name: oCreature
    default: OBJECT_SELF
    desc: | The creature to see if it has the specified talent. (Default: OBJECT_SELF)

description: |
  Returns TRUE if oCreature has tTalent, otherwise FALSE.
remarks: |
  This should help to make TalentSpell() etc. work correctly, by checking if they do have TalentSpell(SPELL_MAGIC_MISSILE). It is not used in any Bioware scripts, and the TalentSpell/Feat/Skill() has never been patched either.
bugs: |
  A bug regarding this causing a STACK_UNDERFLOW_ERROR in all other versions below 1.64 has been fixed in 1.64. It still may not allow TalentSpell() etc. to work correctly, however.
version: 1.64
