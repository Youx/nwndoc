type: Function
name: SetPCLike
shortdesc: Causes a creature to "like" a PC.
return: void
parameters:
  - type: object
    name: oPlayer
    desc: | Player to like.

  - type: object
    name: oTarget
    desc: | Target to alter the feelings of.

description: |
  Sets oPlayer and oTarget to like each other. 
  "Like" is a neutral, non-hostile stance towards the oTarget and vice-versa.
remarks: |
  This obviously will not work if the PC's are in the same party, as they already like each other.
version: 1.29
example: |
  // The PC who entered the trigger is set to like all the PC's in the module
  void main()
  {
      // Get entering PC
      object oEnterer = GetEnteringObject();
      // make sure they are not a DM
      if(GetIsPC(oEnterer) && !GetIsDM(oEnterer))
      {
          // Loop all PC's in the module and set this PC to like them
          object oPC = GetFirstPC();
          while(GetIsObjectValid(oPC))
          {
              // Set to like
              SetPCLike(oEnterer, oPC);
              // Get next PC
              oPC = GetNextPC();
          }
      }
  }
