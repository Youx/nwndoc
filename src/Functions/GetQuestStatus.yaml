  Call to determine the status of the quest 
  returns one of: 
  QUEST_NOT_TAKEN 
  QUEST_IN_PROGRESS 
  QUEST_COMPLETE 
  QUEST_COMPLETE_OTHER
remarks: |
  The return values for this function are variable (not constant) integers declared in the include file. The value QUEST_COMPLETE_OTHER means that the quest has been completed, but by someone other than oPC. 
  This is part of BioWare's quest handling system. Unless you delve thoroughly into that system, and use it all the time, you probably won't need this function.
