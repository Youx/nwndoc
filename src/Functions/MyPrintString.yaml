description: |
  This is a wrapper for PrintString where the PrintString call is commented out.
remarks: |
  Presumably this is used by Bioware for debugging, but uncommenting the PrintString call when they want debugging output (useful because compiler directives for symbols is not supported in NWNScript). 
  The PrintString call is commented out by default. It must be uncommented for this function to do anything at all.
