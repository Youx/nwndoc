type: Function
name: GetIsDoorActionPossible
shortdesc: Determines whether an action can be used on a door.
return: int
parameters:
  - type: object
    name: oTargetDoor
    desc: | The door to be checked.

  - type: int
    name: nDoorAction
    desc: | DOOR_ACTION_*

description: |
  Returns TRUE if nDoorAction can be performed on oTargetDoor, otherwise FALSE.
remarks: |
  This is used by Bioware AI scripts for henchmen to attempt different actions on a door if their masters (PCs) fail to open a door. For example, if the henchmen can cast the spell Knock, the script first checks if GetIsDoorActionPossible(oDoor, DOOR_ACTION_KNOCK) before casting Knock. 
  DoDoorAction can be used to not disrupt an action queue, normally in a creatures OnBlocked event. Of course, this function will return FALSE if oTargetDoor is not a door.
bugs: |
  The DOOR_ACTION_KNOCK parameter is limited to knowing the spell, and will not check what the spell file NW_S0_Knock checks (IE the plot flag).
