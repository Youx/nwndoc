type: Function
name: IPGetHasItemPropertyOnCharacter
shortdesc: Returns whether a character has an item with a certain itemproperty type equipped.
return: int
parameters:
  - type: object
    name: oPC
    desc: | Character to check for itemproperty.

  - type: int
    name: nItemPropertyConst
    desc: | ITEM_PROPERTY_*

description: |
  Returns TRUE if a character has any item equipped that has the itemproperty defined in nItemPropertyConst in it (ITEM_PROPERTY_* constant)
remarks: |
  This function performs a lot of loops, so you might want to be a little careful using it too often.
bugs: |
  Confirmed as of patch 1.61, this function does not check the left hand (offhand) item equipped by oPC.
requirements: |
  #include "x2_inc_itemprop"
version: 1.61
example: |
  #include "x2_inc_itemprop"
  //The NPC doesn't like people with vampiric regeneration on their items
  //put this on the line the NPC will speak if the PC does NOT have vampiric regen
  int StartingConditional()
  {
  object oPC=GetPCSpeaker();
  return !IPGetHasItemPropertyOnCharacter(oPC, ITEM_PROPERTY_REGENERATION_VAMPIRIC);
  }
