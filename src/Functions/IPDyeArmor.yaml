shortdesc: Changes the color of an armor.
return: object
parameters:
  - type: object
    name: oItem
    desc: | Armor to dye.

  - type: int
    name: nColorType
    desc: | ITEM_APPR_ARMOR_COLOR_*

description: |
  Changes the color of an item armor 
  oItem - The armor 
  nColorType - ITEM_APPR_ARMOR_COLOR_* constant 
  nColor - color from 0 to 63 
  Since oItem is destroyed in the process, the function returns the item created with the color changed
remarks: |
  Simply a wrapper function that calls CopyItemAndModify and destroys the original oItem.
bugs: |
  Not really a bug, but: No checks are made to see if the copied item is valid. Thus, it will delete the original oItem even if the function fails, for instance if you feed it something other than an armor for oItem (like a weapon or a placeable).
requirements: |
