shortdesc: Gets the creator of an Area of Effect object.
return: object
parameters:
  - type: object
    name: oAreaOfEffectObject
    default: OBJECT_SELF
    desc: | The Area of effect object you wish to examine. (Default: OBJECT_SELF)

description: |
  Returns the creator of oAreaOfEffectObject. 
  Returns OBJECT_INVALID if oAreaOfEffectObject is not a valid Area of Effect object. 
  It can return OBJECT_INVALID if the creator is invalid or destroyed. Usually the latter. If this happens for a spell script, almost all ResistSpell() function calls, and Will/Fort/ReflexSave functions will not work properley (as they require creatures to be input). For this reason, Bioware recently (1.59+) have added a destroy call to the start of area-of-effect scripts, to destroy them if the creator is invalid.
remarks: |
  Area of Effects are often scripted spells with numerous effects tied to them. This function is best called within the scripts that define an Area of Effect spell.
