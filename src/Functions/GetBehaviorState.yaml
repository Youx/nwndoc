return: int
parameters:
  - type: int
    name: nCondition
    desc: | Bitmask of possible behavior state.

description: |
  Creatures can be created with governing behavior states, as defined by the NW_FLAG_BEHAVIOR_* constants in nw_i0_generic: 
  //Behavior Constants 
  int NW_FLAG_BEHAVIOR_SPECIAL = 0x00000001; 
  int NW_FLAG_BEHAVIOR_CARNIVORE = 0x00000002; //Will always attack regardless of faction 
  int NW_FLAG_BEHAVIOR_OMNIVORE = 0x00000004; //Will only attack if approached 
  int NW_FLAG_BEHAVIOR_HERBIVORE = 0x00000008; //Will never attack. Will alway flee. 
  GetBehaviorState compares nCondition to the creature's behavior state mask, and returns true if they match.
