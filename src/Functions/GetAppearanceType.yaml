type: Function
name: GetAppearanceType
shortdesc: Retrieves the appearance of a specified creature.
return: int
parameters:
  - type: object
    name: oCreature
    desc: | Creature to return the APPEARANCE_TYPE_* value of.

description: |
  Returns the APPEARANCE_TYPE_* value of a specified creature; returns APPEARANCE_TYPE_INVALID for non-creatures or invalid creatures.
remarks: |
  The APPEARANCE_TYPE_* values are references to rownumbers in the appearance.2da file - which means that you can use the value returned by this function to determine stuff about the creature such as height, moverate, sizecategory, etc. 
  You can use SetAppearance to set a different appearence. This will always return the current appearance - including if the person is polymorphed!
version: 1.30
example: |
  // If we are 0 to 5, it is one of the PC's races - we do a 
  // special emote (woohoo cheer emote!)
  void main()
  {
      // As values are 0+, we can check <= 5 for 0 to 5.
      if(GetAppearanceType() <= 5)
      {
          PlayAnimation(ANIMATION_FIREFORGET_VICTORY1);
      }
