type: Function
name: EffectSilence
shortdesc: Create a Silence effect
return: void
parameters:
description: |
  This constructor returns a new silence effect. 
  Silence means spells with the speakingor Verbal component (V) cannot be cast. 
  The target this effect is applied to must be a creature for it to work. This effect cannot be applied instantly, only temporarily or permanently. 
  Of course, this effect will not stack - there are no possible things it does which will stack.
remarks: |
  Some spells, with only Stomatic (moving) components (S) can still be cast - such as lesser dispel. Such spells mearly cannot be cast. Dangerous for mages without the Silent Spell feat. Silenced Spells or Auto-silenced spells can still be cast normally. 
  Items with spells can still be used, and it has no effect on actual speaking with SpeakString, or a PC typing (which is a shame). 
  You can become immune to silence with direct immunity via Immunity: Silence.
version: 1.62
example: |
  // Sample code for applying silence to a target
  void main()
  {
      // This is the Object to apply the effect to.
      object oTarget = OBJECT_SELF;
      // Create the effect to apply
      effect eSilence = EffectSilence();
      // Create the visual portion of the effect. This is instantly
      // applied and not persistant with wether or not we have the
      // above effect.
      effect eVis = EffectVisualEffect(VFX_IMP_SILENCE);
      // Apply the visual effect to the target
      ApplyEffectToObject(DURATION_TYPE_INSTANT, eVis, oTarget);
      // Apply the effect to the object   
      ApplyEffectToObject(DURATION_TYPE_PERMANENT, eSilence, oTarget);
  }
