return: void

    desc: | Seconds to go yet

  - type: object

  This function recursively calls itself once started. Deals a small amount of damage every round, decrementing nSecondsRemaining, until nSecondsRemaining reaches 0.
remarks: |
  Found in nw_s0_acidarrow.nss line 21 
  This isn’t an include file, so you can’t include the function the usual way. Also, this function probably shouldn’t be called on its own – try using the entire nw_s0_acidarrow script instead.
