type: Function
name: GetInventoryDisturbType
shortdesc: Determines the type of disturbance of an inventory.
return: int
parameters:
description: |
  Returns the type of disturbance (INVENTORY_DISTURB_TYPE_*) that caused the caller's OnInventoryDisturbed script to fire.
remarks: |
  This will only work for creatures and placeables. 
  On creatures, it seems only the stolen distrubed type will fire. Placeables cannot have things stolen from them, so they should only return one of the other 2 values.
bugs: |
  It has been previously noted that the event OnDisturbed does not fire when the item being disturbed is gold. There’s still something odd going on with that function. I made this little script and put OnDisturbed of a container: 
  void main() 
  { 
  object oPC=GetLastDisturbed(); 
  object oDisturb=GetInventoryDisturbItem(); 
  SendMessageToPC(oPC, "this: "+GetName(oDisturb)); 
  } 
  When I put gold into the container, I get a message telling me “this: Gold piece”. So it does fire for gold. When I take it back from the container, I get the message “this:” 
  I tested it, and when removing gold from a container, GetInventoryDisturbItem() returns OBJECT_INVALID. 
  Also, there’s a bug with stackable items. If a stackable item is added to another stack in either the givers or receivers inventory, the OnDisturbed event never fires (except for gold pieces, apparently).

  // put this OnDisturbed of a container. Whenever anybody
  // removes an item from the container, they'll be charged
  // that items value for it... Lilac Soul
  void main()
  {
       object oItem=GetInventoryDisturbItem();
       object oPC=GetLastDisturbed();
       int nType=GetInventoryDisturbType();
       switch (nType)
       {
       case INVENTORY_DISTURB_TYPE_REMOVED:
       case INVENTORY_DISTURB_TYPE_STOLEN:
           int nAmount=GetGoldPieceValue(oItem);
           AssignCommand(oPC, TakeGoldFromCreature(nAmount, oPC, TRUE));
           SendMessageToPC(oPC, "Stealing is wrong. Give me your money!");
           break;
      }
  }
