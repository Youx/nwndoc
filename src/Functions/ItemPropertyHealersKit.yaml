return: itemproperty
parameters:
  - type: int
    name: nModifier
    desc: | Kit modifier; 1 to 12 are valid.

description: |
  Sets item property Healers kit. You must specify the level of the kit, which should be an integer between 1 and 12.
remarks: |
  The itemproperty commands are special constructors - they construct an itemproperty "object" which can then be applied to an item using the AddItemProperty command, much like effects need to be first constructed, then applied with ApplyEffectToObject. 
  It will often be a good idea to remove similar itemproperties from the item first. There's a command in the "x2_inc_itemprop" include file called IPSafeAddItemProperty which will do that for you. Check IPSafeAddItemProperty for current bug report. 
  The modifier can be retrieved off this type of item property using GetItemPropertyCostTableValue.
version: 1.61
example: |
  #include "x2_inc_itemprop"
  //The include is for the IPSafeAddItemProperty function
  //FOLLOWING CODE IS SPECULATIVE - NO TEST DEVISED
  //Makes the PC speaker's helmet useable as a healer's kit (?)
  void main()
  {
  object oPC = GetPCSpeaker();
  object oItem = GetItemInSlot(INVENTORY_SLOT_HEAD, oPC);
  if (!GetIsObjectValid(oItem)) return;
  itemproperty ipAdd = ItemPropertyHealersKit(10);
  IPSafeAddItemProperty(oItem, ipAdd);
  }
