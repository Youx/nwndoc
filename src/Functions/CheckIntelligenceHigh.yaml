type: Function
name: CheckIntelligenceHigh
shortdesc: Determines if the Intelligence score of the speaking player is above 14.
return: int
parameters:
description: |
  Returns TRUE if the player character in the conversation has an intelligence higher than 14.
remarks: |
  Function found in nw_i0_plot.nss on line 728. 
  This function always uses GetPCSpeaker() to determine the intelligence score, so using it anywhere besides in a conversation will return FALSE. This was used by BioWare to handle different conversation choices for the players depending on how intelligent they were.
requirements: |
  #include "nw_i0_plot"
version: 1.28
example: |
  //Add as a starting conditional on a conversation thread for a Wizard who will not bother 
  //talking to anyone unless they are exceptionally bright.
  #include "NW_I0_PLOT"
  int StartingConditional()
  {
      int bSmart = CheckIntelligenceHigh();
      return bSmart;
  }
