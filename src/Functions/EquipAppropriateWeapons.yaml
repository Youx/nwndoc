  - type: object
    name: oTarget
    desc: | Creature to examine.

description: |
  Causes the calling creature to equip weapons that are best suited for combat with oTarget. For example, if a lizardman with a club and a magical spear +1 is combatting a skeleton, it will equip the club (as a bludgeoning weapon will deal more damage to a skeleton). The same lizardman, when confronted with a human commoner, will draw the magical spear +1. Will check for most powerful ranged weapon first, then melee.
