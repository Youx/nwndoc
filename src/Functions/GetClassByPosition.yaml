return: int
parameters:
  - type: int
    name: nClassPosition
    desc: | 1, 2 or 3.

description: |
  Returns the CLASS_TYPE_* of the creature for the position nClassPosition. 
  A creature can have up to three classes. This function determines the creature's class (CLASS_TYPE_*) based on nClassPosition. 
  Returns CLASS_TYPE_INVALID if the oCreature does not have a class in nClassPosition (i.e. a single-class creature will only have a value when nClassLocation = 1) or if oCreature is not a valid creature.
bugs: |
  In versions 1.59 - 1.61, this function didn't work with the prestige classes from Hordes of the Underdark. According to BioWare, this will most likely be fixed in patch 1.62.
  As of 1.67, this also works with community based custom classes.
