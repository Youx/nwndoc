description: |
  Decrements the remaining uses per day of a particular feat (FEAT_* constant) for the specified oCreature.
remarks: |
  You must have at least one feat use remaining to be able to decrement it. It won't do anything if they have run out of uses already. 
  Feats which you can use unlimited amounts of time/day, or are not used, cannot be decremented or supressed. 
  Obviously, you must loop until GetHasFeat() is 0 to remove all uses of nFeat on a creature.
bugs: |
  A previous bug with the function actually allowing constant use if the function was used on a creature who had used up thier allowance of a feat, then using this set the amount remaining to -1 (constant/unlimited use) has been fixed.
