description: |
  Sets the creature's PhenoType (body type) to the type specified. 
  nPhenoType has 20 valid values currently: 
  nPhenoType = PHENOTYPE_NORMAL 
  nPhenoType = PHENOTYPE_BIG 
  nPhenoType = PHENOTYPE_CUSTOM1 - PHENOTYPE_CUSTOM18
  The custom PhenoType should only ever be used if you have specifically created your own custom content that requires the use of a new PhenoType and you have specified the appropriate custom PhenoType in your custom content. SetPhenoType will only work on part based creature (i.e. the starting default playable races).
remarks: |
  Note that a phenotype is only valid for the default 7 PC races (Dwarf, Human, Half Elf, Half Orc, Elf, Gnome and Halfling). 
  It is basically the "Fat/Thin" option given when you create your character, however, custom content creators can have a better and more varied use for it as there will no doubt be. 
  As of 1.69, this function supports 99 phenotypes in total.
version: 1.69
example: |
  // Sets the PC's phenotype, in a conversation (maybe some 
  // growth-type one) to the big version.
  void main()
  {
      // Get the PC to change
      object oPC = GetPCSpeaker();
      // Set the phenotype
      SetPhenoType(PHENOTYPE_BIG, oPC);
  }
