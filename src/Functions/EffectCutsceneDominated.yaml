description: |
  Creates an effect that is guranteed to dominate a creature, similiar to EffectDominated, but cannot be resisted. 
  See EffectDominated for Code sample, more remarks and description.
remarks: |
  This is useful for bypassing a person's mind immunity which is common among many NwN items, although it is rarely needed now, because of newer cutseen functions. 
  A nice crevat of this is that more then 1 dominated person can be added to a party, or faction, while EffectDominated only affects one person - and if a new one is targeted, the old one is released from its effects.
