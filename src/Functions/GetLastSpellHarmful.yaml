parameters:
description: |
  Use this in a SpellCast script to determine whether the spell was considered harmful. 
  Returns TRUE if the last spell cast was harmful. 
  Only can be used accuratly in the OnSpellCastAt script of a creature, placeable or door.
remarks: |
  Speculation: Returns TRUE if HostileSetting is set to 1 for this particular spell in spells.2da. 
  That speculation is wrong, it mearly returns the TRUE/FALSE boolean value passed into the EventSpellCastAt(), using SignalEvent(). 
  If it is FALSE, it doesn't mean it was a good spell, it could be any non-hostile (IE: don't initiate combat) spell.

example: |
  if(GetLastSpellHarmful())
  {
      SpeakString("Ouch!");
  }
  else
