description: |
  Increment the remaining uses per day for this creature by one. 
  Total number of feats per day can not exceed the maximum.
remarks: |
  You can not use this command to give a creature feat uses in a feat it doesn't have. 
  It does work on PC's, and is most useful for replenishing feats which have associated script as they are used up (such as a Pale Masters death touch), where the feat was just used from.
