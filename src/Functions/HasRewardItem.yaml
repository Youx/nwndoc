description: |
  See if a PC's party is carrying the reward item.
remarks: |
  Returns TRUE if the party has the reward item in its possession, otherwise it returns FALSE, including if either oPC or oNPC is an invalid object. 
  This is part of BioWare's quest handling system. Unless you delve thoroughly into that system, and use it all the time, you probably won't need this function.
