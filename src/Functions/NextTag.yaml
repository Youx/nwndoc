  Found in nw_c3_waypoint1.nss line 26 
  First of all, this isn’t in an include file, so you can’t use it the ‘normal’ way. Second of all, I have a nagging suspicion that this is an outdated function from before the WalkWayPoint days. I suggest using that function (from nw_i0_generic) rather than this one.
