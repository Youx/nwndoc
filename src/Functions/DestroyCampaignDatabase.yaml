type: Function
name: DestroyCampaignDatabase
shortdesc: Destroys a campaign database.
return: void
parameters:
  - type: string
    name: sCampaignName
    desc: | Campaign database to eradicate.

description: |
  Deletes a campaign database from disk. The campaign database does not go to the computer's recycling bin. After it is deleted, any function using the database will, of course, act as if none were created in the first place. 
  Important Note: Any spaces in sCampaignName are usually removed, stripped, in any Get/SetCampaign*** functions. This doesn't apply to this function, as stated below. For example: 
  - A campaign stored with a string passed in as "Database Name" will be actually stored as "DatabaseName". 
  - When calling DestroyCampaignDatabase("Database Name");, it will actually look for "Database Name", which doesn't exsist! Thus, nothing can be deleted. 
  To get around this, make sure by using GetStringLength() and GetSubString(). An example function to wrapper this function (Provided in part by Mike) will help with variable-length, normally-name-based database names.
remarks: |
  A database consists of files within the database folder of the NWN install directory. Each database uses its own files, so if you have a database called "database1", and one called "database2", they'll be in different files, physically, and destroying one won't do anything to the other. 
  Note that after destroying a campaign database, there's no way of getting it back.

example: |
  // Use this function as a wrapper for the function, as to make
  // sure it enforces no spaces.
  void DeleteVariableDatabase(string sString)
  {
      string sBitString, sNewString;
      int i;
      for(i=0; i < GetStringLength(sString); i++)
      {
          sBitString = GetSubString(sString, i, 1);
          // Check for spaces
          if(sBitString != " ")
          {
               sNewString += sBitString;
          }     
      }
      // Destroy it's database.
      DestroyCampaignDatabase(sNewString);
  }
