type: Function
name: ObjectToString
shortdesc: Converts an object into a hexadecimal string.
return: string
parameters:
  - type: object
    name: oObject
    desc: | The object to convert into a string.

description: |
  Convert oObject into a hexadecimal string for use in debug messages.
remarks: |
  This is totally unique - no other object (at the exact time) will have that reference. 
  It is insanely useful - more so then GetName() and GetTag() to debug exact object's scripts - ObjectToString(OBJECT_SELF) can return an object string for anything. Because it is unique, it can pinpoint exact problems in large scripting tasks.
