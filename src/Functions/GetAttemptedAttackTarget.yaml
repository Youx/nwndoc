description: |
  Get the target that the caller attempted to attack - this should be used in conjunction with GetAttackTarget(). This value is set every time an attack is made, and is reset at the end of combat. 
  Returns OBJECT_INVALID if the caller is not a valid creature.
remarks: |
  Set by attempting to attack somebody, just adding an attack action will set this. The default end of round script clears attack actions if the object loses their target.
