description: |
  Retrieves the base attack bonus for a specified creature. Multiclass creatures' base attack bonuses are added together to retrieve the final result. Returns 0 if oCreature is not a valid creature. 
  A creature has: 
  1 BaB for each fighting level 
  0.75 BaB for each normal (cleric) level 
  0.5 BaB for each bad (mage) level 
  See the manual(s) for exact numbers. It is normally obvious which one of the 3 values each class has.
remarks: |
  This function could conceivably be used to scale the difficulty of foes the PC encounters, or as a way to balance the game by giving PCs without a high attack bonus items which grant this. 
  It could also be used by the AI to check if it can hit the enemy easily, or at all, or to boost thier attack with spells.
