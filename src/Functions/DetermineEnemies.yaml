shortdesc: Returns number of enemies perceived and their combined levels.
return: struct

description: |
  Uses four general categories to determine what kinds of enemies the NPC is facing. 4 categories are: fighter, cleric, mage, and monster. Function uses only first class-slot of a perceived creature to determine enemy class.
remarks: |
  The following classes count as fighters: animals, barbarians, beasts, commoners, constructs, elementals, fighters, giants humanoid, monstrous, paladins, rangers, rogues, vermin, monks, and shapechangers. 
  The following classes count as clerics: clerics and druids. 
  The following classes count as mages: bards, fey, sorcerers, and wizards. 
  The following classes count as monsters: aberrations, dragons, magical beasts, and outsiders. 
  The struct used by DetermineEnemies is called sEnemies and looks like this (the spelling mistake in MONTERS_LEVELS is Biowareâ€™s, not mine): 
  struct sEnemies 
  { 
  int FIGHTERS; 
  int FIGHTER_LEVELS; 
  int CLERICS; 
  int CLERIC_LEVELS; 
  int MAGES; 
  int MAGE_LEVELS; 
  int MONSTERS; 
  int MONTERS_LEVELS; 
  int TOTAL; 
  int TOTAL_LEVELS; 
  };

  #include "nw_i0_generic"
  void main()
  {
  struct sEnemies strEnemies=DetermineEnemies();
  //how many fighter-types are we facing
  int nFighters=strEnemies.FIGHTERS;
  //what are their combined levels
  int nFighterLevels=strEnemies.FIGHTER_LEVELS;
  //how many cleric-types are we facing
  int nClerics=strEnemies.CLERICS;
  //what are their combined levels
  int nClericLevels=strEnemies.CLERIC_LEVELS;
  //how many mage-types are we facing
  int nMages=strEnemies.MAGES;
  //what are their combined levels
  int nMageLevels=strEnemies.MAGE_LEVELS;
  //how many monster-types are we facing
  int nMonsters=strEnemies.MONSTERS;
  //what are their combined levels - I've made no spelling
  //mistakes, Bioware has: it really does say MONTERS
  int nMonsterLevels=strEnemies.MONTERS_LEVELS;
  //how many enemies are there all in all (we could
  //also just add up all the previous numbers)
  int nTotal=strEnemies.TOTAL;
  //what are their combined levels
  int nTotalLevels=strEnemies.TOTAL_LEVELS;
  }
