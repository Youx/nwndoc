description: |
  Makes the caller of the function speak a string representation of its current location.
remarks: |
  Simply calls LocationToString and SpeakString's that. 
  This function will probably only be useful in debugging. 
  Function is found in x0_i0_position, but including nw_i0_generic will suffice.
requirements: |
  #include "nw_i0_generic"
version: 1.61
example: |
  #include "nw_i0_generic"
  //Speak my current location for debugging purposes
  void main()
  {
  SpeakLocation(GetLocation(OBJECT_SELF));
  }
