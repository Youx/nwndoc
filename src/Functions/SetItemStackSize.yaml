type: Function
name: SetItemStackSize
shortdesc: Set the number of items in a given stack.
return: void
parameters:
  - type: object
    name: oItem
    desc: | Item to set the stack size of.

  - type: int
    name: nSize
    desc: | New stack size.

description: |
  Sets the number of items in a given stack. If a number less than 1 is passed, then the stack size is set to 1 (not destroyed like the SetItemCharges function). If a number greater than the maximum stack size for an item of its type is passed, the number of items in the stack is set to the item's maximum stack size.
remarks: |
  Other than removing a single item from a stack of, say, potions (or adding one), this function can be used to determine if an item is stackable or not. See code sample below.
version: 1.30
example: |
  //Returns TRUE if oItem is stackable
  int GetIsStackableItem(object oItem)
  {
  //Must have a chest tagged checkchest
  object oCopy=CopyItem(oItem, GetObjectByTag("checkchest"));
  //Set the stacksize to two
  SetItemStackSize(oCopy, 2);
  //Check if it really is two - otherwise, not stackable!
  int bStack=GetItemStackSize(oCopy)==2;
  //Destroy the test copy
  DestroyObject(oCopy);
  //Return bStack which is TRUE if item is stackable
  return bStack;
  }
