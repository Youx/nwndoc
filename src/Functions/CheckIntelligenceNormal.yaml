type: Function
name: CheckIntelligenceNormal
shortdesc: Determines if the Intelligence score of the speaking player is greater than 8.
return: int
parameters:
description: |
  Returns TRUE if the player character in the conversation has an intelligence greater than 8.
remarks: |
  Function found in nw_i0_plot.nss on line 709. 
  This function always uses GetPCSpeaker() to determine the intelligence score, so using it anywhere besides in a conversation will return FALSE. This was used by BioWare to handle different conversation choices for the players depending on how intelligent they were.
requirements: |
  #include "nw_i0_plot"
version: 1.28
example: |
  //Add as a starting conditional on a conversation thread for an NPC who refuses to talk to 
  //low intelligence players.
  #include "NW_I0_PLOT"
  int StartingConditional()
  {
      int bSmart = CheckIntelligenceNormal();
      return bSmart;
  }
