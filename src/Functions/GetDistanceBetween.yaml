type: Function
name: GetDistanceBetween
shortdesc: The distance in meters between two objects
return: float
parameters:
  - type: object
    name: oObjectA
    desc: | Any object represented in game.

  - type: object
    name: oObjectB
    desc: | Any object represented in game.

description: |
  Returns the distance in meters between two objects. Will return a float value of 0.0 if either of the two objects is INVALID. 
  If the objects are in different areas, or are of invalid object types for this call (EG: The module object) this function will return 0.0.
remarks: |
  This also takes into account the Z-axis, and thusly isn't a direct measurement in only X and Y. To get a direct measurement (discounting the Z-axis) you must use Vectors. 
  Remember, the float value returned by this is in in-game meters. Each in-game tile is 10x10M.

example: |
  // Conversation Action event. Get the distance between
  // me (OBJECT_SELF) and the PC in conversation. If they are 
  // within 5M (including any elevation) we will shout at them.
  // NB: conversations can take place with PC's up to around 10M away
  void main()
  {
      // Get the PC
      object oPC = GetPCSpeaker();
      // Get the distance, and check it
      if(GetDistanceBetween(oPC, OBJECT_SELF) <= 5.0)
      {
          // Shout at them for being quite far away
          SpeakString("Hey, " + GetName(oPC) + " get nearer to me!");
      }
  }
