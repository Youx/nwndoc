description: | 
  The script attached to this event fires when when an object has been locked.
trigger: The door or placeable object has been locked by another object.
remarks: |
  Only placeables that can be opened can be locked or unlocked.

  OnLock and OnUnLock didnâ€™t use to work. As of patch version 1.29 (or probably 1.28), the events fire as they should.
