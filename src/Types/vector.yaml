desc: |
  A structure of three floats, useful for defining positions and orientation vectors. To access the components of the vector, you can use the dot operator to get the x, y, and z components of the vector. The default value of a vector is { 0, 0, 0 } (or x = 0, y = 0, z = 0).
example: |
  vector v = GetPosition(OBJECT_SELF) - GetPosition(oidTargetObject);
  vector v2 = Vector(1.0f, 2.0f, 3.0f);
  PrintFloat(v2.x);
  float fDistanceToTarget = sqrt(v.x * v.x + v.y * v.y + v.z * v.z);
