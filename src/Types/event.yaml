  All of the "events" that run scripts within the scripting language have thier own "event" creation functions, which you can give to any object.
example: |
  // this signal's oldTarget to behave as if they were
  // just attacked by OBJECT_SELF
  event evAttacked = EventOnAttacked(OBJECT_SELF);
  SignalEvent(oldTarget, evAttacked);
