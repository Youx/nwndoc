shortdesc: | 
  Duration types for ApplyEffectAtLocation and ApplyEffectToObject functions.
constants:
  - name: DURATION_TYPE_INSTANT
    value: 0
    desc: | 
      Instantaneous. This would apply to any effect that is both immediate and permanent and cannot be removed. EffectDamage would be one example, as well as any of the 'fire-and-forget' visual effects.
  - name: DURATION_TYPE_PERMANENT
    value: 2
    desc: | 
      Permanent duration. This is as it sounds... the effect lasts until removed or dispelled
  - name: DURATION_TYPE_TEMPORARY
    value: 1
    desc: | 
      A temporary duration means that the effect must have a duration specified in the command (and is the only time this is so). Once the time has expired, the effect will be removed.
