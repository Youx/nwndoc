shortdesc: | 
  Familiars are creatures specially summoned and bound to a wizard or sorcerer. They help the caster with tasks such as gathering spell components, delivering messages, or even combat, although most of them just perch on the wizards shoulder or pointing hat and grin impishly. When a wizard's or sorcerer's familiar dies, the caster suffers physical shock. Note that familiars are different from animal companions.
