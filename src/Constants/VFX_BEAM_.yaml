  Beams fire in a straight line towards their targets. These constants are actually integers which can be found in nwscript.nss and refer to row numbers in the file visualeffects.2da - this file also contains visual effects for which there are no constants. If you want to use one of those, just use EffectVisualEffect(XXX) where XXX is the rownumber.
