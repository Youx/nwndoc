  - name: VFX_DUR_CESSATE_NEGATIVE
    value: 207
    desc: | 
      Causes a small animation to occur to signal that an effect has worn off. The CESSATE effects POSITIVE and NEGATIVE are "effect active" and "effect inactive" effects. Example: Apply both effects at the same time with a duration of 10 seconds. Then first the CESSATE_POSITIVE effect will appear. At the end of the 10 seconds the CESSATE_NEGATIVE effect will appear. So using the CESSATE_NEGATIVE saves the hassle of an additional DelayCommand.

  - name: VFX_DUR_CUTSCENE_INVISIBILITY
    value: 355
    desc: | 
      Makes the target completely invisible - true seeing won't work, hovering the mouse over the invisible avatar or holding down the tab key won't display the name of the invisible character. Very useful in cutscenes, as the screen will always be centered on the PC - thus, moving an invisible PC makes it look like the camera is moving.

  - name: VFX_DUR_FREEZE_ANIMATION
    value: 352
    desc: | 
      Causes a creature to freeze in midanimation. It can be problematic using this for statues: If you script a creature to play an animation, then freeze the creature in the middle of it, you'd expect it to stand that way for the duration of this visual effect. It works perfectly well if the PC is nearby when the visual effect here is applied. If, however, the PC doesn't see the animation being played, and sometimes even if he leaves the area and then comes back, the PC will see the NPC standing frozen, and stiff as a board.
