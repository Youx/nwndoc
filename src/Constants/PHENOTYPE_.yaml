type: Constants
category: PHENOTYPE_*
shortdesc: | 
  Phenotype constants are meant to be used with the functions GetPhenoType() and SetPhenoType(). They should really only be used by custom content people who aim to take advantage of the new way of altering a Player Characters appearance easily.
constants:
  - name: PHENOTYPE_BIG
    value: 2
    desc: | 
      The "Big" phenotype is one of the 2 default options when you create your character - its the larger, slightly fatter and/or more muscly version of chracters.
  - name: PHENOTYPE_CUSTOM1-18
    value: ???
    desc: | 
      As noted in the SetPhenoType() function, this can only be used if a custom content creator knows what they are doing, and add the correct parts to a hakpack file. It would be then used to set a PC's phenotype so cirtain parts of the player will change appearance, and others stay the same, so horses and other similar things can be added, but they still have the same armor/weapons equipped and visible. As of 1.69, there should be 99 values.
  - name: PHENOTYPE_NORMAL
    value: 0
    desc: | 
      The default, "normal" sized phenotype is used for almost all cases to look "normal" and as the models were intended to look. It is one of the two default avalible choices at character creation.
